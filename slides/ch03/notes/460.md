Let’s discuss what you see on this second slide—Merkel’s discs and hair follicles as mechanoreceptors. If you look at the image on the right, you can see the cross-section of the skin showing where these receptors are located. Let’s start with Merkel’s discs, or “tactile discs,” which sit just beneath the epidermis and make direct contact with the underside of the skin. In the image, notice the magnified “spiky” blue cell attached to a nerve ending—the Merkel cell. 
These discs are specialized for fine touch and precise localization; they distort when the skin above them moves. When you lightly press your finger on a surface, the skin’s indentation changes the shape of the Merkel cell, triggering a signal to the brain that says, “Yes, something is pressing here.”
Next, direct your eyes to the lower part of the figure on the right, where you’ll see a hair shaft emerging from the skin with nerve endings coiling around its base. These hair follicle receptors (often called “root hair plexuses”) are also mechanoreceptive, but they specialize in sensing the direction and velocity of hair movement. When your hair is gently brushed or tugged, the hair follicle receptor reacts by signaling to your nervous system, "Hey, something touched my hair!”
Remember that Merkel’s discs and hair follicle receptors are sensitive to mechanical changes in the skin or hair. Merkel’s discs focus on fine, discriminative touch, like reading Braille or detecting a small bump. At the same time, hair follicle receptors help you sense movements on your body surface, especially when something brushes against your skin or an insect lands on you.
