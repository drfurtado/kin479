Now, look at this slide illustrating the right horizontal canal at rest. Notice that the circular diagram represents a cross-section of the semicircular canal filled with endolymph. The pink, wedge-shaped " cupula " structure is a gelatinous barrier that hair cell stereocilia project into. At rest, the cupula has no net deflection because the endolymph and the cupula have equal specific gravity, and the hair cells maintain a baseline (resting) firing rate. 
When the head turns, the endolymph lags due to inertia. This relative fluid movement pushes the cupula, causing the stereocilia to bend toward or away from the kinocilium. Bending toward the kinocilium leads to depolarization and an increase in firing rate, while bending away causes hyperpolarization and a decrease in firing. 
The brain interprets these changes in firing from both the right and left horizontal canals to determine the direction and velocity of head rotation. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining balance, stabilizing gaze, and coordinating head and eye movements during everyday activities.
