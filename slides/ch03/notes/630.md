Let’s continue our exploration of how the vestibular system generates signals. This slide discusses polarization in the hair cells—essentially, how they convert physical movement into electrical impulses that the brain can interpret.
The hair cell depolarizes when the stereocilia (the shorter hair-like structures) bend toward the kinocilium (the tallest hair). In more casual terms, think of depolarization as the “excited state.” It’s like flipping a switch that increases the firing rate of the nerve attached to the hair cell. So, you get a higher firing rate when fluid movement bends those little hairs in that “preferred” direction.
By contrast, when the stereocilia bend away from the kinocilium, the hair cell becomes hyperpolarized—this is like turning the volume down, and the firing rate decreases.
I want you to picture this: each hair cell has a resting firing rate, like a low-level buzzing. If you tip the stereocilia toward the kinocilium, that buzzing ramps up (they fire faster). Tip them the other way, and it gets quieter (they fire slower). This push-pull dynamic lets your brain figure out exactly how your head moves in three-dimensional space.
As we move through our day, the hair cells in our vestibular system are constantly adjusting their firing rates based on these tiny shifts in stereocilia position. It’s an elegant system that provides our sense of balance and orientation. If you think about it, it’s pretty amazing that a simple tilt toward or away from that tallest “hair” can determine whether we feel stable or dizzy!
The big takeaway for polarization is movement toward the kinocilium = excite (depolarize), and movement away = inhibit (hyperpolarize). If you look at the firing rate plot at the bottom of the slide, it shifts from resting to increased rate, back to resting, then to decreased rate, and finally, to resting again. That’s precisely how our inner ear orchestrates head position and movement signals.
