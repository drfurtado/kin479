This diagram illustrates two fundamental spinal reflexes: the flexion reflex and the crossed extensor reflex. These reflexes coordinate the body's immediate response to painful stimuli while maintaining balance and posture.
The flexion reflex is triggered when the foot encounters a painful stimulus, such as stepping on a tack. This reflex involves the rapid withdrawal of the foot from the source of pain. Sensory neurons initiate it by sending signals to the spinal cord, activating the flexor muscles and inhibiting the extensors.
The crossed extensor reflex is a simultaneous, contralateral response that helps maintain balance. While the affected leg is withdrawn, the opposite takes on the body's weight. This is achieved through a network of interneurons in the spinal cord that facilitate the extension of the opposite limb by activating its extensors and inhibiting its flexors.
The ascending pathways for extension are also shown here. They play a key role in adjusting the center of gravity during the reflex action, ensuring we don't fall over while reacting to the stimulus.
These reflexes exemplify the spinal cord's role in rapid motor responses and postural adjustments, independent of brain intervention. It's a protective mechanism ingrained within our nervous system, enabling us to react to potential harm swiftly and efficiently.
