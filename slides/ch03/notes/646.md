In this final illustration, the head has stopped or stabilized after rotating to the right. Because the endolymph is still in motion, it continues pushing on the cupula for a short period even though the head’s velocity has reached zero, interpreted as “negative acceleration” (the brain perceives a change from movement to stillness). 
This lingering fluid movement can continuously stimulate the semicircular canal, leading to a temporary sense of continued rotation, known as post-rotational or post-acceleratory nystagmus. The labeled arrow around the left side of the canal shows that the fluid keeps moving, bending the hair cells in the opposite direction once the head stops. 
This results in hyperpolarization of the receptor cells in the right horizontal canal, decreasing the firing rate, while the opposite ear experiences the complementary effect. Over a brief period, as the fluid settles, the cupula and hair cells return to equilibrium, allowing the vestibular system to once again accurately signal that the head is truly at rest.
