Question: What is the **sequencing and timing problem** in motor control?
Answer: The sequencing and timing problem, also known as the **serial order problem**, explores how movement sequences are ordered in a series. It seeks to understand how elements of a movement, such as the sounds in a phrase or steps in a routine, are arranged in the correct order.

Question: What is **response chaining theory**, and how does it explain movement sequences?
Answer: Response chaining theory suggests that movements are linked together, where each completed movement acts as a stimulus that triggers the next movement in the sequence. Practice strengthens these connections, making actions faster and more effortless.

Question: What are some **criticisms of response chaining theory**?
Answer:
*   It doesn't account for the speed of some movements, which occur too quickly to be triggered solely by feedback from the previous movement.
*   The same action can lead to different outcomes depending on the context, which a rigid chain cannot explain.
*   Movement sequences can continue even when feedback is interrupted, suggesting that there is more than just a simple response chain.
*   It struggles to explain rule-governed behavior.

Question: What is **element-to-position association theory**?
Answer: This theory suggests that movements are linked to mental markers representing their position within a sequence. These markers could also relate to timing, helping explain how actions are timed accurately.

Question: What are the **limitations of the element-to-position association theory**?
Answer: It needs to explain how people learn and follow complex rules that govern sequences. It requires more complexity to account for the real-world flexibility of human action and skill.

Question: How does the **inter-element inhibition theory** explain sequencing?
Answer: It suggests that elements within a sequence inhibit each other. The element receiving the most inhibition occurs later in the sequence.

Question: What are the **problems with the inter-element inhibition theory**?
Answer:
*   It is difficult to model or program due to the complexity of real-world neural processes.
*   It does not explain how people learn and follow complex rules governing the order of actions.

Question: What does the **hierarchical theory** propose about motor control?
Answer: This theory suggests that movement sequences are organized into smaller groups or "chunks" that can be nested within each other to create complex sequences.

Question: What are the **advantages of hierarchical models**?
Answer:
*   They reduce the processing load for the brain.
*   They provide smooth execution and flexibility when adjusting plans.
*   They offer a framework for understanding rule-governed behavior.
*   They accurately predict which sequences will be easy or hard to learn.

Question: What is **Adams' closed-loop theory**?
Answer: This theory focuses on how movements are refined through practice by developing "perceptual goals," which are internal senses of what a successful action feels like. Movements are adjusted to match that internal goal.

Question: What is a **perceptual trace** according to Adams?
Answer: A perceptually defined reference condition for each hand position along a trajectory, which becomes better suited to the completion of a task with practice. Learning reflects the development of more adaptive perceptual traces as well as more adaptive capacities for generating movements that reduce errors between perceptual traces and actual outcomes.

Question: What are the **shortcomings of closed-loop theory**?
Answer:
*   It reduces to a response chaining theory.
*   It applies more straightforwardly to simple movements than complex ones.
*   More knowledge of results (KR) does not always lead to more effective performance.

Question: What is a **generalized motor program (schema)**?
Answer: A schema for a procedure with parameters that affect the forms that actions take. It is a knowledge structure that can be instantiated in different ways depending on the values of its underlying variables or parameters.

Question: What is the **power law of learning**?
Answer: An equation (T = aP^-b) describing how the time to complete a task decreases with practice. The equation can be converted to the equation for a straight line by taking the logarithm of each side of the equation. It applies to various perceptual-motor and intellectual activities.

Question: What are the **stages in Fitts' stage theory of skill acquisition**?
Answer:
*   **Cognitive Stage**: Learning the basic procedures, requiring attention.
*   **Associative Stage**: Refining technique, linking actions to outcomes.
*   **Autonomous Stage**: Performing quickly and consistently with less conscious involvement.

Question: How does **attention** change across the stages of skill acquisition?
Answer: In the early stages, high mental focus is needed, but skill mastery allows that mental space to be used for other things.

Question: How do **degrees of freedom** relate to skill acquisition?
Answer: Novice performers reduce complexity by locking joints, while experienced performers unlock joints, allowing more flexible and efficient movements.

Question: What is the **uncontrolled manifold hypothesis**?
Answer: The idea that some dimensions of movement matter to task success, while others matter little. Motor skill learning involves exploring the effects of different positions in the control space.

Question: What is the difference between **procedural and declarative knowledge**?
Answer: **Procedural knowledge** consists of implicit instructions for performing a series of operations, while **declarative knowledge** consists of facts that can be stated verbally.

Question: How does **long-term memory** relate to motor skills?
Answer: Long-term memory for skills is resistant to forgetting. Well-learned skills show little decrement following retention intervals of weeks, months, or even years.

Question: What is the **ideo-motor theory**?
Answer: This theory suggests that every thought, conscious or unconscious, has a commensurate action. The time to produce a behavior is shorter when the signal for the behavior shares features with the behaviorâ€™s anticipated perceptual consequences.

Question: What is the **parameter remapping effect**?
Answer: The slowing of performance when having to remap parameters, such as accents to letters.

Question: What is the role of **mental practice** in skill acquisition?
Answer: Mental practice can strengthen high-level memory units and aid in learning motor tasks.

Question: What is the **motor output buffer**?
Answer: A limited-capacity store for low-level motor commands.

Question: What is the relationship between **psychology and physiology** in motor control?
Answer: Psychology focuses on behaviors and mental processes, while physiology explores how the nervous system and muscles interact to generate movement. Both are crucial for a holistic understanding of motor control.

Question: How do **hierarchical models** relate to skill acquisition?
Answer: Hierarchical learning shows how mastering simple components first creates a sturdy platform for more advanced skills.

Question: How does **feedback** change across the stages of skill acquisition?
Answer: Initially, you rely heavily on feedback to correct mistakes. Later, less feedback is needed for maintaining skilled performance.

Question: What is the **serial order problem**?
Answer: How multiple elements are combined into a coherent and correctly timed whole.

Question: What does **skill acquisition** involve?
Answer: Skill acquisition involves changes in brain structure and function, muscle coordination, and force control.
