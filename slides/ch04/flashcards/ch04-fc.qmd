## 1. Psychology vs. Physiology {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Psychology vs. Physiology
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
- **Psychology** focuses on mental processes and behavior.  
- **Physiology** examines the structures (nerves, muscles) that enable movement.  
Together, they offer a complete view of motor control.
:::

## 2. Serial Order Problem {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Serial Order Problem
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
The challenge of organizing and timing multiple actions in the correct sequence, like speaking words or executing a sports move.
:::

## 3. Response Chaining Theory {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Response Chaining Theory
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
A theory suggesting each movement triggers the next, like links in a chain. It struggles to explain very fast or flexible actions.
:::

## 4. Critique of Response Chaining {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Critique of Response Chaining
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
1. Too slow for rapid skills.  
2. Doesn’t explain different outcomes from the same action.  
3. Ignores higher-level planning and goals in movement.
:::

## 5. Element-to-Position Association {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Element-to-Position Association
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Proposes each movement step is tied to a specific position (first, second, third, etc.), which helps order actions but struggles with complex, rule-based tasks.
:::

## 6. Inter-Element Inhibition Theory {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Inter-Element Inhibition Theory
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Suggests each action suppresses the others until it’s performed. Oversimplifies real-world tasks where planning and adaptability are crucial.
:::

## 7. Hierarchical Model {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Hierarchical Model
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Suggests actions are grouped into nested “chunks.” Higher levels handle overall goals, while lower levels manage details, allowing flexible, organized movement.
:::

## 8. Adams’ Closed-Loop Theory {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Adams’ Closed-Loop Theory
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Emphasizes using continuous feedback to reduce errors. Learners develop an internal “target feeling” and adjust until movement matches this goal.
:::

## 9. Hierarchical Learning {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Hierarchical Learning
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Skills build in layers. Basic actions become automatic first, so more complex or strategic elements can be added on top.
:::

## 10. Fitts’ Stage Theory {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Fitts’ Stage Theory
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Describes three stages of learning—Cognitive (understanding), Associative (refining), and Autonomous (automatic execution).
:::

## 11. Cognitive Stage {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Cognitive Stage
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Beginners focus on what to do and rely on instructions. Frequent errors occur, and attention demand is high.
:::

## 12. Associative Stage {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Associative Stage
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Learners refine their technique, detect and correct errors more easily, and show more consistent performance.
:::

## 13. Autonomous Stage {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Autonomous Stage
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Skill becomes almost effortless and highly consistent. Movements require minimal conscious thought, allowing multitasking or strategy.
:::

## 14. Attention Changes Across Stages {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Attention Changes
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Early learning requires intense focus on each movement. Later, attention frees up for higher-level tasks or creativity.
:::

## 15. Feedback Changes Across Stages {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Feedback Changes
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Beginners need constant external feedback to correct errors; experts use feedback mainly for fine-tuning, not basic guidance.
:::

## 16. Degrees of Freedom {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Degrees of Freedom
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
The number of ways joints and muscles can move. Skilled learners “unlock” more joints, leading to smoother, more efficient movement.
:::

## 17. Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Certain core features of a movement stay stable while others can vary. This flexibility helps maintain overall success despite small changes.
:::

## 18. Flexibility Example {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Flexibility Example
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
A juggler can adjust wrist position slightly without ruining the toss, as long as the critical release angle remains correct.
:::

## 19. Skill Acquisition: Not Just Mental {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Skill Acquisition
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Practice reshapes both brain and body. Movements become more coordinated, and muscle activation patterns adapt for smoother performance.
:::

## 20. Smoothness & Efficiency {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Smoothness & Efficiency
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
With practice, actions appear more fluid and waste less energy, indicating improved coordination among muscles and joints.
:::

## 21. Hierarchical vs. Chain Models {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Hierarchical vs. Chain Models
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Hierarchical models handle complex, goal-directed tasks by grouping actions into chunks, whereas chain models rely on step-by-step triggers.
:::

## 22. Rapid Movements & Feedback {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Rapid Movements & Feedback
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Very fast skills may not rely on continuous feedback for each step, challenging closed-loop theories that assume constant error correction.
:::

## 23. Juggling & Fitts’ Stages {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Juggling & Fitts’ Stages
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
- **Cognitive:** One ball, focusing on each toss.  
- **Associative:** Detecting errors (too high, too far) and refining.  
- **Autonomous:** Multiple objects with minimal conscious effort.
:::

## 24. Role of Feedback Loops {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Role of Feedback Loops
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Feedback loops let learners compare intended and actual performance, then adjust accordingly. Over time, movements align with the “ideal” pattern.
:::

## 25. Hierarchical Chunks in Music {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Hierarchical Chunks in Music
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Musicians group notes into phrases. Once a phrase is mastered, they can focus on dynamics and expression rather than every individual note.
:::

## 26. Rule-Based Flexibility {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Rule-Based Flexibility
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Skilled performers can skip or reorder actions on the fly, guided by overarching rules and goals, not just a rigid sequence.
:::

## 27. Rehabilitation Application {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Rehabilitation Application
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Therapists use task segmentation and feedback principles to help patients rebuild fundamental movements, then combine them into complex skills.
:::

## 28. Sports Training Application {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Sports Training Application
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Coaches break down complex maneuvers (e.g., gymnastic routines) into chunks. Athletes master each chunk before integrating them into full performance.
:::

## 29. Key Takeaway: Psychology + Physiology {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Psychology + Physiology
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Effective motor control requires mental processes (motivation, planning, feedback) and physical systems (nerves, muscles) working together.
:::

## 30. Complexity of Human Motor Control {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Complexity of Human Motor Control
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition:  
Movement involves layered planning, flexible feedback, and adaptation. Humans go beyond simple reflexes, integrating goals, rules, and learned patterns.
