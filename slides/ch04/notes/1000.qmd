Skill development involves more than just mental strategies and feedback loops; it fundamentally reshapes how our bodies move. Early on, you might notice improvements in speed or precision—like a novice runner shaving seconds off their time. But an equally important change is the smoothness of movement. Experienced athletes or dancers don’t just move faster; they also waste less energy because their joints, muscles, and nervous system are working in harmony.
A key concept here is degrees of freedom. Initially, we tend to lock or limit how many joints we use to control a movement, which can make us look stiff or robotic. With practice, we “unlock” these degrees of freedom, allowing multiple parts of the body to coordinate smoothly. Think of a seasoned swimmer whose entire body moves in a fluid wave versus a beginner who might overuse their arms and barely kick. As we gain expertise, the interplay among muscles and joints becomes more dynamic, giving us a broader range of ways to perform the same action. This adaptability not only makes movements more efficient but also helps us adjust quickly to unexpected changes, like a sudden obstacle on a running path or a tricky spin in a dance routine.
