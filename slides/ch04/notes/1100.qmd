Over the course of this presentation, we’ve seen that movement is far more complex than a simple chain reaction. Early ideas offered valuable insights but had limitations—especially when explaining rapid, adaptable skills. Modern theories emphasize hierarchies, flexible feedback loops, and the interplay between brain and body. We also explored how practice refines both mental representations and physical coordination, unlocking new degrees of freedom. Ultimately, the big picture is that psychological and physiological processes are deeply intertwined, guiding how we learn, perfect, and perform all sorts of motor tasks.
