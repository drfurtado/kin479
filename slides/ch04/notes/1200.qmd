From clinical settings to sports arenas, understanding the psychological foundations of motor control can have a real impact. In rehabilitation, therapists can use feedback-driven practice and task segmentation to help patients regain lost abilities. In sports, coaches can break down complex maneuvers into manageable chunks and provide targeted feedback to refine performance. Musicians, dancers, and other performers similarly benefit from structured practice methods aligned with how the brain learns best. The common thread is leveraging these theories to make training more efficient, engaging, and successful, whether the goal is to relearn basic movements or to achieve elite performance levels. This concludes this lecture. I encourage you to complete the low-stake activity and reflect on how you could apply these concepts to your own practice. I will catch you on the next lecture.
