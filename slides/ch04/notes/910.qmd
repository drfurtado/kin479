As you progress from a beginner to a more advanced performer, your attention moves from being laser-focused on each component of the skill to being more free for strategic decisions or creative flourishes. In the early stages, your mind is consumed by basic execution—imagine a novice golfer trying to remember grip, stance, and swing all at once. Later, once those motions become automatic, you can think about shot selection or environmental factors, like wind speed.
Similarly, control evolves from conscious, step-by-step actions to fluid, coordinated movements. If you’ve ever watched an experienced violinist or a professional soccer player, their actions appear effortless and seamless—no sign of the painstaking details they had to master at the start.
Finally, feedback remains crucial but changes in nature. In the beginning, you need detailed corrections—like a dance instructor pointing out every misstep. As your skill grows, you still benefit from feedback, but it’s more about fine-tuning nuances rather than fixing fundamental errors. This shift underscores the idea that expertise isn’t just about doing things without mistakes; it’s about quickly recognizing and adjusting small deviations for consistently high performance.
