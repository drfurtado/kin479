## Computational Analysis {.quiz-question}

Computational level analysis only deals with simple mathematical calculations, not theoretical frameworks.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Computational analysis involves both complex mathematical modeling and theoretical frameworks."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Computational analysis involves complex mathematical modeling and theoretical frameworks."}

## Neural Networks {.quiz-question}

Neural networks in motor control can serve as both biological systems and computational models.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Neural networks represent both actual brain structures and computational models for understanding movement control."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Neural networks do serve both biological and computational modeling purposes."}

## Control Theory {.quiz-question}

Control theory in motor control only applies to conscious movements, not automatic ones.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Control theory applies to both conscious and automatic movement control."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Control theory applies to both conscious and automatic movement control."}

## Implementation Level {.quiz-question}

The implementation level includes both physical mechanisms and neural processes of movement control.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Implementation level involves both the physical execution and neural control of movement."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Implementation level does include both physical and neural aspects."}

## Motor Units {.quiz-question}

Motor units can function independently of neural input from the central nervous system.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Motor units require neural input from motor neurons to function."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Motor units always require neural input from motor neurons to function."}

## Sensory Integration {.quiz-question}

Sensory integration combines information from multiple sensory systems to guide movement.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Sensory integration involves combining multiple sensory inputs for movement control."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Sensory integration does combine multiple sensory inputs."}

## Movement Disorders {.quiz-question}

Movement disorders only affect physical movement, not the planning or processing of movement.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Movement disorders can affect all aspects of movement, including planning and processing."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Movement disorders can affect all aspects of movement, including planning and processing."}

## Physics Role {.quiz-question}

Physical principles are important for understanding forces and energy efficiency in movement.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Physics principles are essential for understanding movement mechanics and efficiency."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Physics is crucial for understanding movement mechanics."}
