## Motor Control Definition {.quiz-question}

Motor control only focuses on the physical aspects of movement, not the mental processes.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Motor control includes both physical and mental aspects of movement."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Motor control includes both physical execution and mental processes of movement."}

## Movement Production {.quiz-question}

Movement production requires both the nervous system and muscles working together.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Movement production involves both the nervous system for planning and control, and the muscular system for execution."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Movement production requires both systems working together."}

## Feedback Role {.quiz-question}

Feedback in motor control is only useful for correcting errors after they occur.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Feedback is continuous and helps prevent errors before and during movement."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Feedback is continuous and helps prevent errors before and during movement."}

## Engineering Contribution {.quiz-question}

Engineering principles have contributed to motor control research through robotics and biomechanics.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Engineering has significantly contributed through robotics, biomechanics, and control systems."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Engineering has made substantial contributions to motor control research."}

## Movement Adaptation {.quiz-question}

Once learned, movement patterns cannot be modified or adapted to new situations.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Movement patterns can be modified and adapted to new situations."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Movement patterns can be modified and adapted to meet changing demands."}

## Motor Learning {.quiz-question}

Motor learning requires practice and experience over time.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Motor learning is a process that occurs through practice and experience over time."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Motor learning does require practice and experience."}

## Biomechanics Role {.quiz-question}

Biomechanics only considers muscle activity, not the skeletal system's role in movement.

- [True]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Biomechanics studies both muscular and skeletal systems in movement."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Biomechanics studies both muscular and skeletal systems in movement."}

## Control Systems {.quiz-question}

Control systems in motor control involve both conscious and automatic processes.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Control systems involve both conscious and automatic processes in movement regulation."}
- [False]{data-explanation="This is incorrect. Control systems do involve both types of processes."}
