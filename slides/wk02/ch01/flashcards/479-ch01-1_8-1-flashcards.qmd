## Motor Control

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Motor Control
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The study of how humans coordinate and control body movements, including the processes of movement planning, execution, and adaptation.
:::

## Movement Production

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Movement Production
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The process of initiating, planning, and executing physical movements through the coordinated action of the nervous system and muscles.
:::

## Movement Regulation

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Movement Regulation
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The continuous monitoring and adjustment of movements based on sensory feedback to maintain accuracy and achieve desired outcomes.
:::

## Movement Adaptation

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Movement Adaptation
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The ability to modify movement patterns in response to changes in the environment or task requirements.
:::

## Feedback Processing

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Feedback Processing
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The continuous analysis of sensory information during movement to detect errors and make necessary adjustments for improved performance.
:::

## Motor Learning

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Motor Learning
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The process of acquiring and refining movement skills through practice and experience, resulting in relatively permanent changes in movement capability.
:::

## Biomechanics

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Biomechanics
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The study of the mechanical principles of movement in living organisms, including forces, motion, and structural analysis of human movement.
:::

## Control Systems

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Control Systems
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The neural and mechanical mechanisms that regulate movement, including feedback loops, error detection, and movement correction processes.
