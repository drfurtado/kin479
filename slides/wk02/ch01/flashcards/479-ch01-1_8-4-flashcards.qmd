## Turing Test in Motor Control

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Turing Test in Motor Control
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: A method for evaluating whether artificially generated movements are indistinguishable from human movements, used to understand what makes human movement unique.
:::

## Human-Like Motion

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Human-Like Motion
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: Movement patterns that closely resemble natural human movements, incorporating characteristics like smoothness, efficiency, and adaptability.
:::

## Human Factors Engineering

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Human Factors Engineering
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The application of motor control principles to design equipment, interfaces, and environments that optimize human performance and safety.
:::

## Ergonomic Design

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Ergonomic Design
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The practice of designing tools and environments to match human capabilities and limitations, based on motor control principles.
:::

## Animal Research Models

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Animal Research Models
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The study of movement control in animals to understand fundamental principles of motor control that may apply to humans.
:::

## Movement Evolution

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Movement Evolution
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The study of how movement control systems have developed over evolutionary time, providing insights into current human motor capabilities.
:::

## Performance Variability

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Performance Variability
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: Natural variations in movement execution, including both beneficial variability that allows adaptation and unwanted variability that reduces precision.
:::

## Error Correction

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Error Correction
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The process of detecting and adjusting movements in response to mistakes or deviations from intended movement patterns.
