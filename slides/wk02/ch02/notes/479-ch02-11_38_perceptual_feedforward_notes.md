Let's explore one of the ways our brain controls movement - something called feedforward control. Think of feedforward control as planning, like when you're about to throw a ball at a target. Before you even start the throw, your brain has already planned out the entire movement based on what it knows about similar throws you've made before.

This type of control is particularly useful for planned movements. It's like having a mental blueprint of the movement before you start. When you reach for your coffee cup in the morning, you don't need to adjust your movement constantlyâ€”your brain has a pretty good idea of how far to reach and what kind of grip to use based on previous experience.

Feedforward control is especially important for fast movements, where adjustments are impossible. For example, a baseball pitcher throwing a fastball is too quick to make major corrections once the movement starts. The success of the throw depends on how well the movement was planned before it began.

What's neat about feedforward control is that it improves with practice. The more you perform a movement, the more accurate your brain's prediction becomes. It's like having a library of movement plans that your brain can quickly access and use. This is why practiced movements often look smooth and effortless - primarily controlled by this predictive system.

However, feedforward control isn't perfect, so we often need to combine it with feedback control. However, feedforward control is crucial for successfully performing many well-learned movements, especially quick ones. It's one way our brain solves the challenge of controlling movement in a world where things happen too quickly for us to rely solely on sensory feedback.
