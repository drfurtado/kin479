Another fascinating way our body solves the degrees of freedom problem is by choosing efficient movements. If you have multiple ways to accomplish a task, why not choose the one with the least energy? This is exactly what our body tries to do.

Scientists have actually come up with a way to measure this efficiency. They look at the ratio between your body's total work and the energy it uses up. It's like measuring the miles per gallon in your car - you want to get the most movement for the least amount of energy spent.

When discussing your body's work, we need to consider two types. Positive work occurs when your muscles contract, like when you lift a weight. Negative work occurs when your muscles lengthen under control, like when you lower that weight back down. Both types of work are important for understanding how efficiently we move.

But here's what's really interesting: Efficiency isn't the only factor determining how we move. Sometimes, we might choose a less efficient movement because it's more stable, helps us be more accurate, or even because it's what we're used to doing. It's like choosing to take a longer route to work because it has less traffic or is more scenic.

Understanding movement efficiency is super helpful in many situations. Athletes use it to improve their performance while conserving energy. Physical therapists use it to help people recover from injuries by teaching them more efficient ways to move. It even helps us understand why we naturally tend to fall into certain movement patternsâ€”they're often the ones that give us the best balance between getting the job done and not wearing ourselves out.
