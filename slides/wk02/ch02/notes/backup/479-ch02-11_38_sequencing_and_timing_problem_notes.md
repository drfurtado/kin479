Now that we've explored the degrees of freedom problem, let's move on to the sequencing and timing problem. This is all about how we order and time our movements to achieve a specific goal.

One way to think about this is through the concept of reaction time. Reaction time is the time it takes for our body to respond to a stimulus. For simple reactions, this can be as fast as 200 milliseconds. But when we have to choose between multiple stimuli, our reaction time slows down.

So, which skills require sequencing and timing that's faster than 200 milliseconds? Think about activities like playing a musical instrument, typing on a keyboard, or even just walking. In each of these cases, we need to sequence and time our movements quickly to achieve the desired outcome.

But how do we actually achieve this? What strategies does our body use to sequence and time movements effectively?
