Now that we've explored the sequencing and timing problem, let's move on to the perceptual-motor integration problem. This is all about how our senses guide our movements.

One way to think about this is through the concept of feedforward control. Feedforward control is when our body uses prior knowledge and experience to plan and execute a movement. It's like having a mental blueprint of the movement before we even start.

But for which types of movements would we use feedforward control? Think about activities like catching a ball or reaching for a cup. In each of these cases, we use prior knowledge and experience to plan and execute the movement.

Feedforward control is particularly useful for movements that we can plan in advance. It's like having a roadmap that guides us through the movement. But what about movements that require more flexibility and adaptability? How do we use our senses to guide those movements?
