Let's talk about another important concept related to movement control: efficiency. Efficiency is a measure of how effectively our body uses energy to perform a movement.

The formula for efficiency is simple: it's the total work performed by the body divided by the metabolic energy expenditure. But what does this mean in practice?

When we're performing a movement, our muscles are doing work - either concentric (shortening) or eccentric (lengthening). The total work done by our muscles is what we call $W_{TOT}$. But our body also expends energy to perform this work, which is what we call $E$.

Efficiency is important because it helps us understand why our body might choose one movement pattern over another. For example, when you're walking, your body might choose a pattern that's more efficient in terms of energy expenditure, even if it's not the most direct route. This is because our body is always trying to minimize energy expenditure while still achieving the desired movement.

But there are other reasons why we might select a particular movement solution. What are some other factors that might influence our choice of movement pattern?
