One of the most fascinating examples of neural plasticity is phantom limb sensations. When someone loses a limb, they often experience sensations in the missing limb even though it's no longer there.

But what causes these sensations in the brain? The answer lies in the reorganization of the somatosensory cortex. When a limb is lost, the brain must reorganize and adapt to the new sensory information.

This reorganization can lead to some remarkable changes in the brain. For example, the brain area corresponding to the missing limb may start to respond to sensations from other parts of the body. It's like the brain is trying to fill in the gap left by the missing limb.

But what does this mean for our understanding of neural plasticity and recovery? Can we use this knowledge to help people who have experienced trauma or injury?
