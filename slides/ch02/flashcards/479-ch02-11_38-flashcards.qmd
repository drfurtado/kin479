## Movement Synergies {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Movement Synergies
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Teams of muscles working together as a single unit to simplify movement control, reducing the number of elements the brain needs to control independently.
:::

## Simple Reaction Time {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Simple Reaction Time
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
The time taken to respond to a single stimulus, approximately 200 milliseconds.
:::

## Choice Reaction Time {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Choice Reaction Time
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
The time taken to respond when choosing between different possible responses, longer than 200 milliseconds.
:::

## Neural Plasticity {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Neural Plasticity
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
The brain's ability to adapt and change its structure and function in response to experience, learning, and injury.
:::

## Mirror Neurons {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Mirror Neurons
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Brain cells that activate both when performing an action and when observing others perform the same action.
:::

## Feedback Control {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Feedback Control
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
A movement control system that uses sensory information to make corrections and adjustments during ongoing movement.
:::

## Feedforward Control {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Feedforward Control
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
A movement control system where actions are planned and executed based on predicted outcomes, without waiting for sensory feedback.
:::

## Movement Sequence {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Movement Sequence
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
A pre-programmed routine of movements that can be triggered to unfold automatically, allowing faster execution than individual reactions.
:::

## Degrees of Freedom Problem {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Degrees of Freedom Problem
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
The challenge of how the nervous system manages and controls the numerous possible ways to perform a movement.
:::

## Perceptual-Motor Integration {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Perceptual-Motor Integration
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
The process of combining sensory information with motor output to guide and adjust movements.
