Now let's talk about the other major way our brain controls movement - feedback control. While feedforward control is like having a plan in advance, feedback control is all about making adjustments as you go. It's like driving a car - you're constantly making small corrections to the steering wheel based on what you see and feel.

Feedback control relies on our senses - vision, touch, proprioception (our sense of where our body parts are), and other sensory information. This incoming information helps us know if our movement is going as planned or if we need to make adjustments. Think about when you're trying to pour water into a glass - you're constantly watching the water level and adjusting the angle of the pitcher to avoid spilling.

This type of control is especially important for movements that need to be precise or when the environment is unpredictable. When you're threading a needle, for example, you're using visual feedback to make tiny adjustments to get the thread through the eye. Or when you're walking on an uneven surface, you're constantly using feedback from your feet and eyes to maintain your balance.

What's fascinating about feedback control is how fast it can work, even though it's not instantaneous. There's always a small delay between when your senses detect something and when your brain can process that information and make adjustments. But our nervous system is remarkably good at dealing with these delays, often anticipating what kind of feedback we're likely to receive.

The real beauty of human movement control is how we combine feedback and feedforward control. For most movements, we use both systems - feedforward to get the movement started in roughly the right way, and feedback to fine-tune it as we go. This combination allows us to be both quick and accurate in our movements, adapting to changes while maintaining smooth, coordinated actions.
