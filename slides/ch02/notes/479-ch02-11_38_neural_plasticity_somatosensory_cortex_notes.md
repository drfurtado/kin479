Let's now examine the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that receives information from mechanoreceptors like muscle spindles. This information is crucial for our sense of proprioception, which is our ability to sense the position and movement of our body.

But how does the somatosensory cortex contribute to neural plasticity? What role does it play in our ability to learn and adapt?

The answer lies in the way the somatosensory cortex processes information. When we practice a new movement, the somatosensory cortex actively processes sensory information from our muscles and joints. This information helps our brain to refine and adapt our movement patterns.

But what about people who experience damage to the somatosensory cortex? How does that affect their neural plasticity and ability to learn new movements?
