Welcome to Chapter 2, where we'll explore four fundamental problems in human motor control. These problems represent key challenges our nervous system must solve to produce skilled movement.

Let me introduce you to these core themes. First, we have the degrees of freedom problem - how do we manage the countless possibilities for any movement? When you reach for a cup, there are infinite ways to position your joints, yet your nervous system efficiently selects one pattern.

Next is the sequencing and timing problem. Think about activities like playing piano, typing, or serving in tennis. How does your nervous system organize movements in the correct order with precise timing?

The third challenge is perceptual-motor integration. Whether walking on uneven surfaces or catching a ball, you must constantly integrate sensory information with movement. How does this integration work?

Finally, we'll explore neural plasticity - how our brain adapts and changes. This is crucial for learning new skills, recovering from injuries, and understanding how movement control develops throughout our lives.

This chapter will examine these problems and how they interact to create skilled movement. Let's begin!
