Another fascinating way our body solves the degrees of freedom problem is by choosing movements that are efficient. Think about it like this - if you have multiple ways to accomplish a task, why not pick the one that uses the least energy? This is exactly what our body tries to do.

Scientists have actually come up with a way to measure this efficiency. They look at the ratio between the total work your body does and the energy it uses up. It's like measuring the miles per gallon in your car - you want to get the most movement for the least amount of energy spent.

When we talk about the work your body does, we need to consider two types. First, there's positive work - this happens when your muscles contract, like when you're lifting a weight. Then there's negative work, which occurs when your muscles are lengthening under control, like when you're lowering that weight back down. Both types of work are important for understanding how efficiently we move.

But here's what's really interesting - efficiency isn't the only factor that determines how we move. Sometimes we might choose a less efficient movement because it's more stable, or because it helps us be more accurate, or even because it's what we're used to doing. It's like choosing to take a longer route to work because it has less traffic or is more scenic.

Understanding movement efficiency is super helpful in many situations. Athletes use it to improve their performance while conserving energy. Physical therapists use it to help people recover from injuries by teaching them more efficient ways to move. And it even helps us understand why we naturally tend to fall into certain movement patterns - they're often the ones that give us the best balance between getting the job done and not wearing ourselves out.
