Now that we've explored feedforward control, let's talk about feedback control. Feedback control is when our body uses sensory information to adjust and correct our movements. It's like having a continuous conversation between our senses and our movements.

But which types of movements are controlled by feedback? Think about activities like walking on uneven surfaces or threading a needle. In each of these cases, we use sensory information to adjust and correct our movements.

Feedback control is particularly useful for movements that require flexibility and adaptability. It's like having a GPS system that guides us through the movement and makes adjustments as needed.

But how do we actually use feedback to control our movements? What senses do we rely on, and how do we integrate that information into our movement patterns?
