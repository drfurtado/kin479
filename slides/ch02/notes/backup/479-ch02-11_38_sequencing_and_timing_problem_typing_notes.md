Let's take a closer look at typing as an example of sequencing and timing. When you're typing, you're performing a complex sequence of movements with your fingers. But how is this possible if our reaction time is typically slower than 200 milliseconds?

The answer lies in a phenomenon called co-articulation. Co-articulation is when we plan and prepare for one movement while we're still performing another. It's like our body is constantly looking ahead and anticipating the next movement.

Co-articulation is common in activities like speech, drawing, and writing. When you're speaking, you're not just focusing on the current word - you're also planning the next word and the one after that. Similarly, when you're typing, you're not just pressing the current key - you're also preparing to press the next key.

This ability to plan ahead and overlap our movements is what allows us to perform complex sequences quickly and efficiently. It's a remarkable example of how our body adapts and simplifies movement control through practice and repetition.
