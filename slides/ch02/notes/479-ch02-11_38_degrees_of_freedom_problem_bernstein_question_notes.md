Let's dive deeper into Bernstein's question about how we select movement patterns. This is a fundamental issue in motor control because it gets at the heart of how we coordinate our movements.

One way to think about it is through the concept of hierarchical organization. Imagine a pyramid where at the base, you have individual muscle activations. These activations are then coordinated to control joint angles, and finally, these joint angles come together to form integrated movement patterns.

This hierarchical approach helps simplify the complexity of movement control. Instead of trying to control every single muscle fiber, our nervous system can focus on higher-level patterns and let the lower-level details take care of themselves.

But how does this actually work in practice? Let's consider a simple example like reaching for a cup. At the highest level, our brain decides on the overall movement pattern - in this case, reaching forward and grasping the cup. Then, our nervous system coordinates the joint angles and muscle activations necessary to achieve that pattern. It's a remarkable process that happens seamlessly, yet it's something we often take for granted.
