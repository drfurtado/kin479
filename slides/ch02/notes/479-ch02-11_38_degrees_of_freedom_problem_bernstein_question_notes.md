Let's explore Bernstein's question about how we select movement patterns. This is a fundamental issue in motor control because it concerns the heart of coordinating our movements.

One way to think about it is through the concept of hierarchical organization. Imagine a pyramid with individual muscle activations at the base. These activations are then coordinated to control joint angles, and finally, these joint angles come together to form integrated movement patterns.

This hierarchical approach helps simplify the complexity of movement control. Instead of trying to control every muscle fiber, our nervous system can focus on higher-level patterns and let the lower-level details care for themselves.

But how does this actually work in practice? Let's consider the simple example of reaching for a cup. At the highest level, our brain decides on the overall movement patternâ€”in this case, reaching forward and grasping the cup. Then, our nervous system coordinates the joint angles and muscle activations necessary to achieve that pattern. It's a remarkable process that happens seamlessly, yet we often take it for granted.
