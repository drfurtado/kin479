## Movement Synergies {.quiz-question}

Movement synergies help simplify motor control by allowing the brain to direct pre-organized teams of muscles rather than controlling each muscle independently.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Like a soccer team executing practiced plays, synergies allow the brain to manage coordinated groups of muscles instead of controlling hundreds of individual muscles separately."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Synergies do simplify motor control by grouping muscles into functional teams, reducing what the brain needs to control."}

## Neural Plasticity in Youth {.quiz-question}

Young people's brains are less adaptable than adult brains, making it harder for them to learn new skills.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Young brains are actually more adaptable, like softer clay that's more easily molded."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Young people's brains are especially adaptable, making it easier for them to learn new skills like languages or sports compared to adults."}

## Reaction Time {.quiz-question}

Simple reaction time to a single stimulus is typically faster than choice reaction time when choosing between different responses.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Simple reaction time is about 200 milliseconds, while choice reaction time (like choosing between different tennis responses) takes longer due to the added complexity of decision-making."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Choice reaction time does take longer than simple reaction time due to the additional processing needed for decision-making."}

## Movement Sequences {.quiz-question}

Fast movement sequences, like piano playing, are limited by our basic reaction time of 200 milliseconds per movement.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. We can perform movements faster than our reaction time by grouping them into pre-programmed sequences that unfold automatically."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! We can perform faster sequences by grouping movements into pre-programmed routines, like dominoes that automatically trigger once set up."}

## Mirror Neurons {.quiz-question}

Mirror neurons in the brain activate only when we physically perform an action, not when we observe others performing it.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Mirror neurons activate both when performing an action AND when watching others perform the same action."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Mirror neurons activate both when performing an action and when observing others, creating a mental mirror of others' movements."}

## Feedback Control {.quiz-question}

Feedback control in movement involves constant adjustments based on sensory information, similar to steering a car.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Like driving a car, feedback control involves constantly making adjustments based on sensory input (vision, touch, proprioception) during movement."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Feedback control does involve continuous adjustments based on sensory information during movement."}

## Neural Plasticity After Injury {.quiz-question}

After brain injury, there is a period of increased neural plasticity that can aid in recovery and rehabilitation.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Following brain trauma, the brain enters a period of increased plasticity - like clay becoming temporarily more pliable - which is crucial for rehabilitation and recovery."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. There is indeed a window of enhanced plasticity after brain injury that can help with recovery."}

## Synergy Development {.quiz-question}

Movement synergies are innate and don't require practice to develop.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Synergies are learned through practice - initially movements are awkward because we control everything separately."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Synergies develop through practice as the brain learns which muscles work well together and organizes them into efficient teams."}

## Observation Learning {.quiz-question}

Watching skilled performances can completely replace physical practice in learning motor skills.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. While observation through mirror neurons can enhance learning, it cannot completely replace physical practice."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! While mirror neurons help us learn by observing, we still need actual physical practice to develop capabilities and fine-tune control."}

## Movement Control Integration {.quiz-question}

Most skilled movements rely on a combination of both feedforward and feedback control systems.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! We use feedforward control to initiate movements and feedback control to fine-tune them, allowing for quick, accurate, and adaptable movements."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Skilled movements do combine both feedforward planning and feedback adjustments for optimal control."}
