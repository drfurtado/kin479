## Review and Preview

:::::::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Previous**: Degrees of Freedom Problem
  - Selecting optimal movements
  - Synergies and coordination
  - Efficiency in movement

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Next**: Sequencing and Timing Problem
  - Organizing movement components
  - Temporal precision
  - Motor planning

## 2. Sequencing and Timing - Reaction Time

::::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
- How do we order and time movements that have distinct parts?
- Simple reaction time (typically 200 ms): Time it takes to respond to a single stimulus
- Choice reaction time (typically more than 200 ms): Time it takes to respond to stimuli with multiple pairs
- Which skills need to be sequenced and timed faster than 200 ms?

## 2. Sequencing and Timing - Co-articulation

:::::::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Typing Example
  - Skilled typists type faster than they can consciously process
  - Fingers move in anticipation of future keystrokes
  - Movements are organized in advance
