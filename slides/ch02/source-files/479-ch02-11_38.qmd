## Four "Problems" - Introduction

- **Core Themes** in Human Motor Control:
  1. **Degrees of Freedom**: Selecting optimal movements from infinite possibilities
  2. **Sequencing and Timing**: Organizing movement patterns effectively
  3. **Perceptual-Motor Integration**: Using sensory input to guide movement
  4. **Neural Plasticity**: Understanding brain adaptation and reorganization

## Degrees of Freedom Problem

::::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Definition**: 1 degree of freedom = 1 plane of rotation about a joint
- **Challenge**: Managing multiple degrees of freedom across joints
- **Key Questions**:
  - How do we select from infinite movement possibilities?
  - What guides our movement choices?
  - How do we achieve coordinated movement?

## 1. Degrees of Freedom Problem

::::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Bernstein's Question** (1967):
  - How do we select appropriate movement patterns?
  - What principles guide movement selection?
- **Hierarchical Organization**:
  1. Muscle activation coordination
  2. Joint angle relationships
  3. Integrated movement patterns

## 1. Degrees of Freedom Problem – Solutions

::::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Synergies : Groups of muscles that act as a single functional unit
- Reduces the number of DOF to control
- Synergies are typically learned

## 1. Degrees of Freedom Problem -- Solutions

Efficiency :

$$\varepsilon = \frac{W_{TOT}}{E}$$

- $\varepsilon$: Movement efficiency
- $W_{TOT}$: Total work performed by the body
- Positive work: Concentric muscle activity
- Negative work: Eccentric muscle activity
- $E$: Metabolic energy expenditure
- Other reasons why we would select a solution?

## 2. Sequencing and Timing Problem

::::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
- How do we order and time movements that have distinct parts?
- Simple reaction time (typically 200 ms): Time it takes to respond to a single stimulus
- Choice reaction time (typically more than 200 ms): Time it takes to respond to stimuli with multiple pairs
- Which skills need to be sequenced and timed faster than 200 ms?

## 2. Sequencing and Timing Problem

- Typing
- How is this possible if the time it takes to respond to a stimulus can't be less than 200 ms?
- Co-articulation: Planning and preparing for one movement while performing another
- Common in: Speech, drawing/writing, keyboarding

## 3. Perceptual-Motor Integration Problem

- Perception and action are closely linked—but how?
    - Two independent processes: feedforward and feedback
- Feedforward control :

![](../images/slide_10_picture-5.png)

- For which types of movements would we use feedforward control?

::: {.notes}
{{< include ../notes/479-ch02-11_38_perceptual_feedforward_notes.md >}}
:::

## 3. Perceptual-Motor Integration Problem

- Feedback control
- Which types of movements are controlled by feedback?

{{< include ../notes/479-ch02-11_38_perceptual_feedback_notes.md >}}
:::

## 3. Perceptual-Motor Integration Problem

- Mirror Neurons: same brain activity while observing movement as performing the movement
- Can we "practice" through perception?
- Perception and movement are "coupled"

{{< include ../notes/479-ch02-11_38_perceptual_mirror_notes.md >}}
:::

## 4. Neural plasticity

::::: columns

::: {.column width="65%"}
- We re-organize neural circuitry due to experience, practice, or development
- Younger people are more "plastic" than older people
- Trauma to the brain can make it more "plastic" for a certain period of time

## 4. Neural plasticity

- Somatosensory cortex: Receives information from mechanoreceptors (e.g., muscle spindle)

## 4. Neural plasticity


- Phantom limb sensations
- Reorganization of somatosensory cortex

## Summary

- Degrees of Freedom Problem: How do we select the correct movement among infinite solutions?
- Sequencing and Timing Problem: How do we order our movements?
- Perceptual-Motor Integration Problem: How do we use sensory information to shape movement?
- Neural plasticity: How does the brain reorganize due to age, experience, or trauma?

## The Four "Problems" - Conclusion

- How do we organize all degrees of freedom?
- How do we sequence and time our movements?
- How do perception and action interact?
- How does the brain adapt to new movements?
