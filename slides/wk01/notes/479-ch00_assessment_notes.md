Hey there! Let me walk you through how we'll track your learning in this course. ðŸ“š

Our weekly rhythm:
- I'll post new stuff every Monday by 5 PM
- You'll have until next Monday to complete everything
- Quick chapter quizzes to check your understanding

The big stuff:
- Midterm: March 17
- Final Exam: May 13
- Group Presentation: Your chance to apply what you've learned!

Pro tip: Start with the textbook readings (Human Motor Control, 2nd Edition) - they're your foundation for everything else. And remember, Canvas is your home base for all materials and submissions. Work at your own pace, but stay on track! ðŸ˜Š
