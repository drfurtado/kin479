Let me share some fascinating movement disorders you might want to explore in your group project:

- Parkinson's Disease: Shows us what happens when the brain's movement control centers are affected. Think tremors and stiffness - it's like the brain's autopilot is glitching!

- Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Imagine if your brain's messages kept getting interrupted on their way to your muscles. That's MS for you!

- Cerebral Palsy: This one starts early in life and teaches us tons about how our developing brain learns to control movement.

- Essential Tremor: The most common movement disorder you've probably never heard of! Really shows us how the brain handles precise movements.

- Huntington's Disease: A window into how our genes affect movement. Super interesting from a genetic perspective!

There are many more to choose from, but these are some fan favorites. Pick something that sparks your curiosity - whether it's brain development, genetics, or how our nervous system works. I'm here to help you dive deep into whichever one you choose! ðŸ§
