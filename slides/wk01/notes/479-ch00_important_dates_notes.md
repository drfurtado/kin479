Let me walk you through our key dates this semester! Here's what you need to know:

Every week, I'll post new stuff on Monday by 5 PM, and you'll have until the next Monday to complete everything. Easy, right?

For your group presentation:
- Group leaders: Submit three topic ideas by Feb 10
- Record your presentation (15 mins max) by April 14
- Want extra credit? Watch your classmates' presentations and ask questions by April 21
- Everyone needs to do peer evaluations by May 13

And don't forget our exams:
- Midterm: March 17
- Final: May 13

Keep an eye on Canvas - that's where all the action happens! ðŸ˜Š
