Hi everyone! I'm Dr. Furtado, and I will be your instructor for KIN 479. I will share a bit about myself and my passion for motor control and movement disorders.

I'm currently an Associate Professor here in the Department of Kinesiology at California State Northridge. What really drives me is understanding how our brains control movement, especially in people with neurological conditions. It's fascinating work that combines basic science with real-world applications.

My line of research focuses on three main areas: (1) validation of observational models in psychomotor assessment instruments; (2) the relationship between motor skill competence, perceived motor competence, physical activity levels, and body composition; (3) using AI pattern recognition models to assess fundamental movement skill in children.

Throughout this course, I'll be sharing lots of real-world examples from my research and clinical experience. I think you'll find it fascinating to see how the principles we learn in class apply to actual movement disorders and rehabilitation.
