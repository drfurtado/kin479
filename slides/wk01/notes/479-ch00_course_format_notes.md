Let me explain how this course will be structured. KIN 479 is delivered entirely online, and I've designed it to give you flexibility while ensuring you get a comprehensive understanding of motor control concepts.

Each week's materials will be posted by 5:00 PM on Monday, and you'll have until the following Monday to complete that week's assignments. This asynchronous format allows you to learn and digest the materials at your own pace, which is especially helpful for complex topics in motor control.

The course materials will include recorded lectures that accompany your weekly readings from our textbook, Human Motor Control (2nd Edition) by David A. Rosenbaum. I strongly recommend completing the readings first, before starting other course-related tasks for the week.

All materials, grades, and discussions will be accessed through Canvas. Each week's content will have its own dedicated page on our Canvas site, making it easy to find everything you need. You'll find lecture recordings, reading assignments, quizzes, and any other materials organized by week.

Since this is an online course, there's no physical attendance requirement. Instead, your engagement with the course will be demonstrated through the quality of your assignments, participation in online discussions, and performance on weekly quizzes and exams.
