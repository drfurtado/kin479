Let me share with you how we'll stay connected throughout the semester. Good communication is key to your success in this course, and I want to make sure you know the best ways to reach me and get the help you need.

For all course-related communication, please use the Canvas Inbox system. This helps me keep track of student communications and ensures a timely response. You can also reach me by phone at 818-677-5968 if needed.

I hold office hours every Tuesday and Thursday from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in my office, RE 289. If these times don't work for you, I'm also available by appointment - you can schedule one easily at https://bit.ly/drfurtado-appointment.

All course materials will be delivered through Canvas. You'll find the weekly materials, assignments, grades, and discussions all on our Canvas site. I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the course pages during the first week.

Please remember to use clear and respectful language in all communications, whether through email or discussion posts. Being mindful of diverse perspectives and identities is an important part of maintaining our respectful learning environment.

If you need additional support, CSUN offers various resources. For students with disabilities, the Office of Students with Disabilities Resources (818-677-2684) can help arrange accommodations. I encourage you to request any needed accommodations early in the semester.
