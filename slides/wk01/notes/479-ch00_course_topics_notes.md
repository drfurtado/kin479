Hey there! Let me walk you through what we'll be learning in this course. I've organized everything in a way that'll help you build your understanding step by step.

We'll start with the basics - getting to know what motor control is all about (that's in Chapters 1 and 2). Then, we'll explore how our senses work (Chapter 3), with a special deep dive into vision (Chapter 6). It's fascinating stuff - you'll see how your body takes in information and uses it to control movement!

Next up, we'll look at motor physiology (more from Chapter 3) and dive into the psychology of motor control (Chapter 4). I really enjoy this part because we get to explore different theories about how humans control movement. Trust me, it's more interesting than it might sound!

The second half of the course is where things get really hands-on. We'll look at specific types of movement:
- How we walk and run (Chapter 5)
- The way we reach and grab things (Chapter 7)
- What happens when we write or draw (Chapter 8)
- How we control our voice (Chapter 10)
- And even how we make facial expressions (Chapter 11)

Throughout all of this, we'll be using our textbook - it's the second edition of Human Motor Control by David A. Rosenbaum. I'll post recorded lectures each week to help explain the concepts, and you'll have weekly quizzes to check your understanding. Don't worry though - I'll be here to help you every step of the way!
