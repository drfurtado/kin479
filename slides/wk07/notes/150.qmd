From the chapter, we learn that focusing on a single task repetitively—often called “consistent practice”—seems intuitively beneficial, but research shows that “variable practice” can lead to more robust skill transfer. In other words, by practicing multiple related tasks, learners develop a more adaptable generalized motor program capable of handling new or slightly altered conditions. 

A memorable example detailed in the literature involves children practicing with beanbags of varying weights. Those who practiced throwing different weights were better at adapting to a brand-new weight than those who had only practiced with a single weight. The flexibility gained from variable practice enhances our capacity to “tune” parameters for novel situations—like adjusting throwing force or release angle when encountering a new object or distance.

Although it may appear paradoxical that doing many variations could outperform sheer repetition of one task, variable practice encourages the formation of abstract movement schemas. Consequently, these schemas can be applied more readily to new but related tasks. This finding is especially relevant in fields like physical therapy or athletics, where diversity in training often promotes quicker recovery or improved performance under changing conditions.
