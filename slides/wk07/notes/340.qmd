Let's talk about keeping things simple in science. We call this parsimony. It means developing theories that aren't more complex than they need to be. Remember Ockham's razor? It tells us not to add extra assumptions unless necessary. But in motor control, we face a tricky balance. Too simple, and our theory misses important details. Too complex, and it becomes impractical.

Think of it as a map. A theory should be like a good map. Not every tiny detail of the landscape needs to be included. Just enough to get you where you're going. In motor control, we're constantly adjusting this level of detail.

Imagine a graph with two axes. One shows how much a theory explains. The other shows how complex it is. The ideal spot is the upper left corner. That's where simple theories explain lots of phenomena. In reality, theories often drift away from this ideal spot. This happens as researchers add details to handle new findings.

This balance between simplicity and thoroughness appears in all sciences. It's not just motor control. Biology, physics, psychologyâ€”all face the same challenge. We want theories that are elegant. They should reveal core principles. But they must also work in messy real-world situations.

Finding this balance is challenging. Yet it's exactly what makes creating optimization theories so fascinating. It's essential for advancing our understanding of how we move. The best theories are both streamlined and comprehensive. They tell us what matters without getting lost in details.
