Parsimony—keeping theories as simple as possible—serves as a guiding principle in developing optimization frameworks. Ockham’s razor reminds us not to pile on extra assumptions unless they’re truly needed. Yet, in motor control, we face a real balancing act: if a theory is too simple, it might not capture the nuances of human movement; if it’s too intricate, it risks becoming unwieldy or overly tailored to specific scenarios.

We can envision a “theory space” where one axis represents how many phenomena a theory explains (its explanatory breadth) and the other reflects its complexity (like the number of parameters, assumptions, or equations). In an ideal world, we’d station ourselves in the “upper left” corner of that space, where we account for many aspects of behavior with very few assumptions. But in practice, theories often drift away from that sweet spot as researchers refine models to handle new data or unanticipated exceptions.

This compromise between simplicity and thoroughness isn’t unique to motor control. The same tension is present in biology, physics, psychology—virtually any scientific discipline. Our goal is to craft theories elegant enough to illuminate the core principles of movement, yet robust enough to accommodate real-world variability. It’s a tall order, but it’s precisely what makes the pursuit of parsimonious, yet comprehensive, optimization theories so engaging—and so necessary—for advancing our understanding of motor behavior.
