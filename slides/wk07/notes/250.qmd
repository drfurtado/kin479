Dynamical Systems Theory has proven remarkably flexible, finding applications well beyond the simple two-finger oscillation task. Researchers often aim to identify or develop mathematical models whose terms correspond to meaningful causal influences—such as excitatory or inhibitory connections between neural oscillators in rhythmic tapping tasks. This approach allows us to see how small shifts in neural dynamics can lead to large, observable changes in movement timing or coordination.

In more physically rooted tasks, like swinging two handheld pendulums, the governing equations stem from classical physics principles—gravity, mass, torque—and the patterns of coupling between the hands. Yet, what makes Dynamical Systems Theory particularly powerful is its ability to incorporate cognitive elements as well. For instance, a person’s intention to synchronize pendulum swings or coordinate them in antiphase could be conceptualized as shifting a parameter in the model—perhaps similar to changing the ratio of “excitatory” to “inhibitory” effects in a neural circuit. 

By embedding cognitive factors into these models, we start to capture not only the external mechanics but also the internal decision-making or attentional processes that shape how movements unfold over time. Whether it’s explaining why a drummer locks into a groove with perfect timing or understanding how a dancer synchronizes limbs in a complex routine, Dynamical Systems Theory offers a framework to account for both the physical and psychological underpinnings of coordinated behavior.
