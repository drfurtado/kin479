Building on the concept of variable practice, one plausible explanation for its benefits is that we develop an “average” of our experiences—much like computing a running average of numbers. According to the chapter, when these practice instances (or numbers in an example) are presented in a random order, the running average that our motor system constructs becomes more robust and less influenced by any single instance. As a result, the representation of the skill stabilizes, leading to improved long-term performance and transfer to new tasks.

For instance, consider a tennis player practicing various serve placements: wide, down the middle, or into the body. In the variable (random) approach, they frequently switch targets, forcing themselves to continuously adapt. This challenge results in a more “flexible” serving schema—similar to constantly updating that running average. Meanwhile, the player's short-term performance may appear good in a blocked approach (repetitively serving to one spot before moving on). Still, they do not develop the same level of adaptability.

When it’s match time and the player must serve to multiple spots in quick succession, the athlete with a more stable, “averaged” representation from variable practice can more easily adjust. They have essentially trained their motor program to handle changing conditions and demands. In contrast, the player who practiced in a strictly blocked manner may find the sudden switches more challenging. In this regard, variable practice not only enhances adaptability but also fosters the kind of cognitive-motor flexibility that is vital for effective sports performance.
