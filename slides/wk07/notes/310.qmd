A central theme in Optimization Theory is that the motor system behaves like a problem-solver, constantly seeking the most “cost-effective” way to achieve movement goals. Just as a business tries to maximize profits while reducing expenses, our bodies aim to minimize energy use, reduce fatigue, or optimize accuracy when performing tasks. For example, when reaching for a cup on a table, the brain doesn’t randomly activate muscles; it chooses a movement path and muscle activation pattern that balances speed, efficiency, and accuracy. 

This principle can extend to a variety of tasks: running, throwing a ball, or playing a musical instrument. In each scenario, the motor system “tests” possible solutions (either implicitly through trial-and-error or guided by past experiences) and updates its strategies to refine performance. This quest for an optimal solution can occur at multiple levels—ranging from high-level planning (e.g., choosing the right angle to release a basketball shot) to subtle adjustments in muscle recruitment (e.g., controlling individual fingers on a piano keyboard).  

Many different optimization criteria have been proposed, including minimizing jerk (sudden changes in acceleration), minimizing overall energy, or minimizing movement time. Which criterion becomes most relevant often depends on the specific demands of the task, the environment, and the individual’s goals or skill level. Although pinpointing the exact objective function the brain uses can be tricky, Optimization Theory remains highly influential in explaining how people coordinate their movements so effectively—despite the body’s immense complexity.
