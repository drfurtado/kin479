Welcome back everyone. Last time we explored how the motor system controls the order and timing of our movements. We looked at how small movements are organized, whether in playing music or performing dance routines.

Today we shift our focus to three key theories. These will help us understand why and how movements happen as they do. First, we'll explore Generalized Motor Programs theory. This shows how general movement patterns guide our actions. Next, we'll examine Dynamical Systems theory. It reveals how changing conditions can suddenly alter movement patterns. Finally, we'll discuss Optimization theory. This theory explains how our motor system selects movement strategies. It balances factors like accuracy, speed, and energy use. Together, these theories give us a clearer picture of motor control. They build on what you learned about movement order and timing in our previous session.
