Welcome back, everyone. Last time, we looked at how the motor system controls the precise order and timing of our movements. We explored how each small movement is organized and managed, whether you’re playing a musical instrument or doing a dance routine.

Today, we’re changing focus to look at three key ideas that provide better understanding of why and how movements happen the way they do. We’ll start with Generalized Motor Programs theory, to see how general movement patterns guide our actions. Then, we’ll check out the Dynamical Systems theory, which highlights how changes in conditions can suddenly change movement patterns. Lastly, we’ll talk about Optimization theory, which suggests that our motor system chooses movement strategies by balancing costs like accuracy, speed, or energy usage. Together, these theories give us a clearer view of motor control, building on what you learned about order and timing in our last session.
