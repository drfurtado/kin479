Welcome to our first major topic: Generalized Motor Programs, or GMPs. From the readings, you might remember that Adams’ closed-loop theory highlights how repeated practice and feedback narrow our movement patterns, explaining the importance of practice. However, as the chapter points out, closed-loop processes alone struggle to explain how people easily adjust to new or slightly different situations—this is where skill generalization becomes important. 

A simple example, drawn from various athletic situations, is a basketball player who has spent hours practicing free throws from the foul line. Although the player’s practice took place mostly at one spot on the court, they can still perform a well-coordinated jump shot from the baseline or the three-point line. According to GMP theory, this is because the player’s motor program for shooting a basketball is not limited to just one spot on the court. Instead, they have developed a more flexible, generalized idea of the shooting action. This stronger pattern enables them to adjust their technique—changing distance, force, and angle—across different game situations. 

In upcoming slides, we’ll see how GMP theory builds on the strengths of closed-loop explanations while adding the key idea of movement templates. This concept allows for variety in practice and movement execution, giving insight into why someone can shoot, pass, or dribble with relative ease in new conditions.
