Let's explore our first major topic: Generalized Motor Programs (GMPs). Our readings introduced Adams' closed-loop theory. This theory shows how repeated practice and feedback narrow our movement patterns. It explains why practice is so important. However, closed-loop processes have a limitation. They struggle to explain how we adjust to new or slightly different situations. This is where skill generalization becomes important.

Consider a basketball player who practices free throws from the foul line. They spend hours at this one spot. Yet they can still perform a coordinated jump shot from the baseline or three-point line. GMP theory explains this ability. The player's motor program for shooting isn't limited to just one spot. Instead, they develop a flexible, generalized shooting action. This pattern lets them adjust their technique. They can change distance, force, and angle across different game situations.

In our upcoming slides, we'll see how GMP theory builds on closed-loop explanations. It adds the key concept of movement templates. This idea allows for variety in practice and execution. It helps explain why someone can shoot, pass, or dribble easily in new conditions.
