Schemas and generalized motor programs help us adapt learned skills to new situations. Think about shooting a basketball or writing your signature in different contexts. Our textbook chapter describes schemas as broad "knowledge structures." We form these structures through repeated experiences. Each time we perform a movement, we collect valuable information. We learn about initial conditions, movement outcomes, and sensory feedback. All of this contributes to building a schema.

A "generalized program" works like a schema for a specific class of actions. It comes with adjustable parameters. Consider your handwriting as an example. You can write in different sizes or at various speeds. Yet certain fundamental features of your pen strokes stay consistent. We see this in sports too. A soccer player uses the same core movement pattern for passing. But they adjust the exact force and angle based on the required distance or speed.

This approach explains two important things. First, it shows how we handle variability and novelty. We can adapt without having practiced every possible variation. Second, it explains why our movement patterns remain consistent over time. Think of shooting a basketball from different distances. Or signing your name on different sized surfaces. The generalized program stays the same. Only the parameters change to fit the context.
