Schemas and generalized motor programs, help us understand how individuals can take a learned skill—such as shooting a basketball or writing their signature—and flexibly adapt it to new situations. From the chapter, you might recall that schemas are broad “knowledge structures” formed through repeated experiences. Each time we perform a movement, we gather information about initial conditions, movement outcomes, and sensory feedback, all of which contribute to a schema.  

A “generalized program” is... essentially a schema for a specific class of actions, complete with adjustable parameters. For instance, in handwriting, regardless of the size or speed at which you write, certain fundamental features of your pen strokes remain consistent. In sports, consider a soccer player’s pass—the core movement pattern remains the same, but the exact force and angle are adjusted to accommodate the required distance or speed.  

This approach not only accounts for variability and novelty in performance (we can adapt without having practiced every possible variation), but it also explains how individual movement patterns remain remarkably consistent over time. Whether we’re shooting a basketball from the free-throw line or the three-point line. Or whether we’re signing our name on a large poster or a small notepad, the generalized program remains the same while the parameters are recalibrated to fit the context.
