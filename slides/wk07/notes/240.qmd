The Haken–Kelso–Bunz (HKB) equation provides a succinct mathematical model for understanding how coordination patterns emerge and shift in tasks like the two-finger oscillation experiment. Essentially, it specifies a potential energy function in terms of the relative phase (Φ) between two moving fingers and uses the ratio of two parameters—b and a—to capture how stable each coordination pattern is.

When the ratio b/a changes, the shape of the potential energy landscape is altered, affecting which coordination pattern (in-phase at Φ = 0° or anti-phase at Φ = 180°) is more stable. At lower speeds (or lower b/a ratios), both patterns can coexist, but as speed increases—or as b/a passes a critical threshold—the anti-phase pattern loses stability, and the system spontaneously transitions to an in-phase pattern.  

What makes this model so valuable is that it clearly links a mathematically specified landscape (the potential function) to the observable behavioral shift people demonstrate in real time. While we used finger movements here as a simple demonstration, the same principles help explain the emergence and disruption of stable movement patterns in many other contexts. For instance, small changes in running speed or cycling cadence can tip the system from one well-coordinated gait into another, much like flicking a switch.
