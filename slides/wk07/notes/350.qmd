A helpful way to visualize how the motor system plans movements is by drawing on the concept of keyframes and interframes in animation. In animation, the keyframes are the major, defining positions of a character or object, while the interframes fill in the transition between these significant poses. Translating that idea to motor control, we can imagine that our body uses “goal postures” (keyframes) for critical points in a movement and then rapidly interpolates the intermediate positions (interframes) en route to each goal.

For example, reaching for a cup on a cluttered table might have a few main postural landmarks: start position, an “elevated elbow” posture to clear obstacles, and the final posture grasping the cup. Between these keyframes, the motor system calculates a sequence of joint configurations—much like the automated in-between frames of a digital animation. Each joint’s rotation and path are determined by cost factors such as energy, speed, or the need to avoid hitting objects. In practice, we rarely think consciously about each step of this interpolation; the central nervous system is adept at evaluating and selecting efficient “in-between” movements automatically, while accounting for constraints like obstacle avoidance or fatigue.

Not every movement demands the same optimization criteria. Some tasks require minimal exertion, while others emphasize speed or precision. By flexibly adjusting which variables are most important at any moment—like how an animator chooses the main dramatic poses and then fine-tunes the transitions—the human motor system can gracefully adapt to a vast range of movement challenges.
