Have you ever watched animation being created? Animators use something called keyframes. These are the major positions in a sequence. Think about how your body plans movements in a similar way.

In animation, keyframes show the most important poses. The spaces between get filled with interframes. Your motor system works like this too. It focuses on goal postures. These are like keyframes for your body. Then it fills in all the movements between those important positions.

Let me give you an example. Imagine reaching for a cup on a crowded table. Your movement has a few key positions. First, there's your starting position. Next, you might raise your elbow to avoid obstacles. Finally, there's the grasp of the cup. These are your keyframes.

How does your body move between these positions? Your motor system calculates all the joint movements needed. It's similar to how animation software creates interframes. Your brain considers factors like energy use and obstacle avoidance. You don't think about each of these steps consciously. Your nervous system handles this automatically.

Different movements need different optimization strategies. Some tasks require minimal effort. Others need speed or precision. Your motor system adapts to each situation. It's like how an animator chooses dramatic poses first. Then they carefully craft the transitions. This flexibility helps you handle countless movement challenges throughout your day.
