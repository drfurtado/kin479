Here, we see how generalized motor programs (GMPs) become more flexible—or more time-consuming—depending on how many parameters we need to specify. In the experiment described in the reading, the researchers looked at finger-tapping sequences in which participants decided whether to use their left or right hand. If the two tapping sequences were mirror images of each other, only a single parameter—left or right hand—had to be adjusted. Because the motor system simply “flipped” the sequence, it made the choice much faster.  

However, when the two sequences were not mirror images, additional parameters came into play—like exactly which finger taps were required in the sequence. As a result, participants needed more time to set these extra parameters before executing the movement. This finding underscores one of the key advantages of GMPs: They’re efficient when only one or two parameters need to be changed, but as soon as more variables have to be specified, the response time naturally increases.  

Think of it like customizing a basic recipe: If you only need to decide whether to add sugar or salt, that’s easy. But if you also have to choose different spices, cooking temperatures, and so on, it takes longer to finalize your decision. In the same way, our motor system can rapidly “flip” a known pattern (mirror image) but must slow down when configuring multiple or more detailed parameters.
