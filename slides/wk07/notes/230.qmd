One of the most iconic demonstrations of Dynamical Systems Theory in motor control is the two-finger oscillation task, first explored by Cohen and later modeled by Haken, Kelso, and Bunz. In this task, participants move their index fingers back and forth in time with a metronome—initially maintaining an “anti-phase” pattern in which each finger points in opposite directions. However, when the metronome’s frequency increases beyond a certain threshold, participants spontaneously switch to an “in-phase” pattern, where both fingers point in the same direction.  

This abrupt shift, often termed a “phase transition,” is a prime example of how the coordination of movements can spontaneously reorganize under changing constraints. The HKB model explains this phenomenon using a concept known as a potential energy landscape. At lower frequencies, two stable states (in-phase and anti-phase) are both accessible, but anti-phase gradually loses stability as speed increases. Eventually, the system “falls” into the in-phase state, a more stable attractor at higher frequencies.  

Importantly, once the fingers switch to in-phase, participants rarely revert back to anti-phase unless the frequency is lowered again—demonstrating how some attractor states become more dominant under certain conditions. This key insight shows that our motor system is not simply executing pre-planned instructions. Instead, it behaves like a self-organizing system, constantly adjusting in response to internal and external constraints.  

Beyond fingers, similar phase-transition phenomena have been observed in activities like coordination between arms, legs, or even group dynamics in sports. These findings underscore the broad explanatory power of Dynamical Systems Theory for understanding how complex movement patterns emerge, stabilize, and shift due to seemingly small changes in task demands or environmental factors.
