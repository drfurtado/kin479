:::

## Smooth Pursuit {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: **Smooth Pursuit**
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: **Tracking of a moving target** across the visual field, with the CNS goal being matching of velocity of target and saccades matching position of target.

## Vestibular-Ocular Reflex (VOR) {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: **Vestibular-Ocular Reflex (VOR)**

:::

## Visual Cortex {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}

## Hemifields and LGN {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: **Hemifields and LGN**
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: **Visual information from the right hemifield of both eyes is transmitted to the left LGN and information from the left hemifield to the right LGN**. This crossover is crucial for binocular vision and depth perception.
