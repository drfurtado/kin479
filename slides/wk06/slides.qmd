## 1. Psychology vs Physiology

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Psychology  
  - No reference to structuring of the central nervous system  
  - Brain, musculoskeletal system, etc. is a "black box"  

- Physiology  
  - Neurophysiology: how the central nervous system and musculoskeletal system work together to produce movement  
  - CNS is included in stimulus-response loop

## 2. The Sequencing and Timing Problem

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. A core challenge in motor control is understanding how we order and time our actions flawlessly.  
2. Consider the intricate coordination needed to speak a simple phrase, play a musical piece, or execute a sports skill.  
3. This puzzle of precise sequencing is also known as the serial order problem.

## 3. Response Chaining: An Old Theory

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. This classic idea suggests that movements are linked together like a chain.  
2. Each completed movement acts as a signal, triggering the next in a smooth, automatic sequence.  
3. An influential early psychologist, William James, believed that practice strengthens these connections, making actions faster and more effortless.

## 3.1 Response Chaining: The Problems {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
1. Movements often take time for each one to be triggered solely by feedback from the last. This means our reactions would lag behind if we relied only on this slow chain reaction.  
2. The same action can lead to different results depending on the situation. Think of hitting a baseball—sometimes it's a home run, sometimes an out. This challenges the idea of one movement automatically triggering a specific next move.  
3. Even if you interrupt feedback during a movement sequence, the action sometimes continues. This suggests there's more going on than just a simple response chain.  
4. Despite attempts to defend or modify Response Chaining, the biggest challenge is that our actions are guided by rules and goals, not just simple reactions.

## 4. Element-to-Position Association Theory

- This theory suggests movements are linked to mental markers representing their position within a sequence (like first, second, third, etc.).  
- If these markers also relate to timing, it could partially explain how we time our actions accurately.  
- Limitation: The theory needs to work on explaining how we learn and follow complex rules that govern sequences. It needs to be more complex for the real-world flexibility of human action and skill.

## 5. Inter-Element Inhibition Theory

- Suggests that elements within a sequence try to suppress each other.  
- The element receiving the most inhibition occurs later in the sequence.  
- Problems:  
  1. Difficult to model or program due to the complexity of real-world neural processes. It oversimplifies how our brains control movement.  
  2. Doesn’t explain how we learn and follow complex rules governing the order of actions. It leaves out the importance of deliberate planning and goal-oriented behavior.

## 6. Hierarchies: The Power of Organization

1. This theory suggests that movement sequences are organized into smaller groups, like building blocks. These groups, or “chunks,” can then be nested within each other to create complex sequences.  
2. Imagine each chunk having its own internal control, reducing the processing load for the brain.  
3. By organizing our actions into hierarchies, we can achieve both smooth execution and flexibility when adjusting plans.

## 7. Adams' Closed-Loop Theory

1. This theory focuses on how we refine our movements through practice.  
2. Key Idea: We learn by developing “perceptual goals”—an internal sense of what a successful action feels like.  
3. We then adjust our movements to try and match that internal goal.

## 8. Hierarchical Learning: Building Skills Block by Block

1. This theory suggests skill development happens in layers, with lower-level skills forming the foundation for more complex ones.  
2. Think of building a structure: you start with strong basic blocks, which then support more elaborate constructions on top.

## 9. Fitts’ Stage Theory: A Roadmap for Learning

This theory breaks down skill acquisition into three main phases:

1. **Cognitive Stage:** The ‘thinking’ phase where you grasp the basics and figure out what needs to be done.  
2. **Associative Stage:** The ‘experimenting’ phase. You refine your technique, linking actions to outcomes.  
3. **Autonomous Stage:** The ‘mastery’ phase. The skill becomes more natural, requiring less conscious effort.

</audio>

## 9.1 What Changes Across Stages

- **Attention:** Early on, you need high mental focus. Skill mastery allows that mental space to be used for other things (strategic thinking, adjusting on the fly).  
- **Control:** Movements shift from deliberate and step-by-step to smooth and increasingly automatic.  
- **Feedback:** Initially, you rely heavily on feedback to correct mistakes. Later, less feedback is needed for maintaining skilled performance.

## 10. Skill Acquisition: Not Just Mental

1. Learning isn’t just about your brain! Skills change how your body moves:  
   - Faster & More Precise: The obvious improvement we all aim for.  
   - Smoothness & Efficiency: Movements start to feel effortless, with less wasted energy.  
2. Degrees of Freedom: This is about unlocking new movement possibilities within your joints and muscles. Practice allows for more complex coordination.

## 10.1 How Does This Happen? (Theories)

1. **Hierarchical Learning:** Skills develop in layers. Lower-level coordination becomes automatic, freeing up your attention for more complex movement patterns.  
2. **Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis:** Our brain learns to separate ‘essential’ movements for success from those less crucial to the task, allowing for flexibility without hindering accuracy.

## 11. Major Takeaways

1. Motor control involves both cognitive and physiological processes working together.  
2. Early theories (like Response Chaining) paved the way for more nuanced, hierarchical, and feedback-based models.  
3. Skill acquisition is a layered process: initial conscious control gives way to automaticity and adaptability.

## 12. Practical Applications

1. **Rehabilitation:** Applying hierarchical and feedback-based models to design better therapy programs for stroke or injury recovery.  
2. **Sports Training:** Using goal-oriented feedback and chunking strategies to help athletes master complex skills faster.  
3. **Music & Performance:** Employing stage theories to progress from basic techniques to effortless, expressive execution.
