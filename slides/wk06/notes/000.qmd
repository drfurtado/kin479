This lecture explores the ways our thoughts, motivations, and learning processes shape how we move. We’ll look at how psychology and physiology intersect to produce the coordinated actions we take for granted—like speaking, playing an instrument, or competing in sports. By reviewing historical theories and more recent models, we’ll see how our understanding of motor control has evolved. Ultimately, these insights aren’t just academic; they can inform everything from injury rehabilitation to peak athletic performance. Let’s begin by setting the stage for what’s to come and why it matters to anyone interested in human movement.
