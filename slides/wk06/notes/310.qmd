In theory, if each movement had to wait for feedback from the previous one, we’d be far too slow for everyday activities like fast typing or playing a musical instrument. Our real-world experiences demand rapid, overlapping actions that leave little time for a strict, one-step-after-another chain.
Moreover, a single movement can lead to drastically different outcomes depending on the context—imagine swinging at a baseball pitch. Sometimes, you hit it out of the park; other times, you strike out, even though the basic movement might feel similar. A rigid link between steps can’t explain that level of flexibility.
Another major critique is that the movement often continues if we cut off feedback partway through an action. It’s as if our brain has already planned the sequence instead of reacting in the moment. That’s a strong sign that we operate with higher-level planning and goals rather than simple chained reactions.
Ultimately, these problems highlight why, while historically important, Response Chaining doesn’t fully capture the complexity of human motor control. We plan ahead, adapt to changes, and integrate rules and goals into our actions—far beyond what a straightforward chain reaction can explain.
