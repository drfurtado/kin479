Inter-Element Inhibition Theory proposes that each part of a sequence is simultaneously active, but some parts are suppressed until it’s their turn to ‘take the stage.’ While this idea acknowledges that multiple actions can play simultaneously, it still treats movement control as an internal wrestling match—whoever is ‘least inhibited’ gets to go next.
The main issue is that this model underestimates just how complex and adaptable our motor planning can be. In real-life scenarios, like cooking a meal or performing an athletic maneuver, we aren’t just passively waiting for one action to ‘stop inhibiting’ the next. We actively plan ahead, follow rules or strategies, and respond to changing circumstances. Our behavior is guided by overarching goals and feedback from the environment, not just internal suppression between movement elements.
Because it doesn’t account for higher-level planning and the flexible use of rules, Inter-Element Inhibition Theory struggles to explain how we seamlessly reorder or skip actions when the situation demands it. Nevertheless, it remains historically important to highlight that multiple actions can be represented in the brain simultaneously—an idea that paved the way for more advanced, hierarchical models of motor control.
