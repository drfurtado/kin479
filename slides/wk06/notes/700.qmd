Adams’ Closed-Loop Theory emphasizes that we use ongoing feedback to gradually fine-tune our movements. Imagine learning a gymnastics move: each time you practice, you build an internal “blueprint” of how the move should feel—its balance, timing, and muscle sensations. Repeating the move, you compare your actions to that internal target and make subtle corrections.
This approach is powerful because it highlights the role of sensory feedback (like feeling off-balance or noticing you’re too late in a rotation). Over time, your perceptual goal becomes more precise, and your movements become more accurate. However, one limitation of this theory is that it sometimes struggles to explain rapid movements or those performed without continuous feedback. Even so, Adams’ Closed-Loop Theory set an important foundation for understanding how we learn new skills through iterative practice and feedback.
