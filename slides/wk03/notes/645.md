In this illustration, the head continues to rotate to the right, and initially, the endolymph still lags, pushing the cupula and increasing the firing rate on the right side. However, as the rotation continues at a constant velocity, the fluid eventually moves at the same speed as the canal walls. Hence, there is no longer a relative motion to bend the cupula. 
When acceleration is zero—the velocity is constant—the hair cells return to their resting position, and the firing rate returns to baseline. In other words, the sensation of “turning” fades even though the head is still moving at the same speed. This phenomenon helps us understand that semicircular canals primarily detect changes in angular velocity (acceleration) rather than constant motion. 
Once the brain senses this cessation of acceleration, it interprets the movement as steady, and the vestibular signals will not continue to fire at a heightened level despite the ongoing rotation.
