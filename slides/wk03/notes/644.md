When the head rotates to the right, the endolymph in the right horizontal canal lags behind and effectively moves to the left relative to the canal. This movement deflects the cupula so that the stereocilia bends toward the kinocilium, leading to the depolarization of the hair cells and an increase in the firing rate. On the left side, however, the mirror image occurs: the fluid shifts opposite relative to the left canal, bending the stereocilia away from the kinocilium and decreasing the firing rate. 
The small diagram on the left of the slide illustrates that an increased impulse frequency or excitation comes with depolarization. The brain receives these signals from both ears, compares the degree of excitation and inhibition, and interprets them as a rightward head rotation. This push-pull dynamic is fundamental for detecting angular acceleration and maintaining a stable gaze during activities like turning your head to look in a new direction.
