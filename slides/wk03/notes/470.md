Look at this final recap slide comparing glabrous (hairless) and hairy skin, and notice how each receptor is distributed throughout the layers. Merkel’s discs are found near the epidermal-dermal border, and free nerve endings are visible just above them. Meissner’s corpuscles, often located in the dermal papillae, are right below the epidermis and are responsible for detecting light touch. 
Pacinian corpuscles lie deeper in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, sensing deep pressure and vibration. Ruffini’s endings, also in the dermis, respond to stretch. 
Finally, in the hairy skin region, you’ll see the hair follicle receptors wrapped around the hair shafts, detecting even the slightest movements of each hair. This comparison helps us see how each receptor has a unique location and specialized role, giving us our richly detailed sense of touch and proprioception.
