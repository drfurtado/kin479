At rest, the right horizontal canal is shown with endolymph and cupula in equilibrium, meaning there is no net deflection of the cupula. The pink wedge-shaped " cupula " structure is a gelatinous barrier that the hair cells project into. Because it has nearly the same density as the surrounding endolymph, it remains neutral when the head is not moving. 
The hair cells in this position maintain a baseline or resting firing rate, as indicated on the left side of the slide. This constant low-level discharge is important for the push-pull mechanism between the two ears: if one canal increases its firing during a head turn, the opposite side decreases in firing. 
At rest, however, both sides are balanced, providing no signal to the brain of angular acceleration. Understanding this baseline condition sets the stage for how even slight head movements change the firing rates and inform the brain about rotation, helping us maintain balance and coordinate our gaze.
