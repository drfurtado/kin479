Let’s pick up where we left off with tactile receptors and focus on two important types of mechanoreceptors: the Pacinian corpuscle and the Ruffini’s corpuscle.
If you remember from the previous slide (4.4), we talked about free nerve endings and Meissner’s corpuscles—those handle sensations like pain, temperature, and light touch. Now we’re shifting gears to these two specialized structures that each handle different aspects of mechanical stimulation:
The Pacinian Corpuscle is our high-frequency vibration detector, perfect for detecting fast, “buzzing” sensations.
It fires or discharges when it encounters roughly 100–300 Hz frequencies. If you imagine using a power tool or an electric toothbrush, that “tingly” feeling in your hand is exactly what Pacinian corpuscles pick up.
Structurally, think of them like an onion, with layer upon layer that helps to filter out slower or constant pressure. They’re really sensitive to sudden changes in pressure or vibration, which is how they excel at detecting quick, transient stimuli.
The Ruffini’s Corpuscles are also mechanoreceptors, but they sit parallel to the surface of the skin.
They’re especially good at picking up skin stretch. When your skin is pulled or elongated—say, if you grip something or twist your wrist—these receptors notice the elongation of collagen fibers and send a signal to your nervous system.
This “stretch feedback” is vital for monitoring joint positions and for assessing body posture. Without Ruffini’s corpuscles, it would be difficult to discern the subtle changes in skin stretch that help you modulate grip force or coordinate more refined movements.
So, why does it matter that we have all these different receptors (from Meissner’s to Pacinian to Ruffini’s)? It’s because our skin and deeper tissues must provide a full spectrum of tactile and proprioceptive information to our brain. You need some receptors to detect light touch, some to handle deeper pressure or stretch, and still others to sense temperature or pain. Each receptor type plays a part in building your overall sense of proprioception, which is basically your awareness of where your body is in space.
If you think about day-to-day activities like typing on a keyboard or holding a cup of coffee, you’re constantly using these receptors to gauge how hard you press the keys or how firmly you’re gripping your mug. Pacinian corpuscles keep track of sudden changes (like the little vibration when you set the cup down), while Ruffini’s corpuscles help you adjust for any ongoing stretch in your skin or shift in your posture.
In short, each corpuscle has its own special role in helping us navigate the physical world. Together, they form a dynamic network that feeds our brains constant updates about everything from a subtle breeze brushing against our skin to the strong vibration of a running blender. That’s pretty amazing when you think about it—and it’s all happening just beneath the surface, largely without us even noticing it consciously!
