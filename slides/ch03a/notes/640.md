This illustration provides insight into how our vestibular system responds to head motion, which is crucial for balance and orientation.
The top part of the figure shows the head in motion, indicating the directional flow that this movement will cause in the fluid within the semicircular canals.
As we direct our attention to the lower part of the figure, we see a detailed view of the semicircular canals on the left and right sides. Note the axis of the hair cells and how fluid motion within the canals stimulates these cells, leading to changes in neural firing rates.
When the head turns, fluid motion in the canals lags due to inertia, causing the hair cells to deflect. On the side towards which the head turns, the fluid moves in the opposite direction, increasing the firing rate of the afferent nerve VIII. Conversely, on the opposite side, firing decreases.
The brain interprets this differential in firing rates between the two sides as rotational movement. It allows for quick and reflexive adjustments in posture to maintain equilibrium, whether we're simply turning our heads or engaging in more complex physical activities.
We just described the vestibular system's role in detecting head movement and maintaining balance, using the provided illustration to highlight the physiological processes involved.
