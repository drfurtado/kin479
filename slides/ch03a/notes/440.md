This slide provides a closer look at the tactile receptors in the skin, the sophisticated network that enables us to sense touch, pressure, and pain. These receptors transform mechanical stimuli into neural signals that our brain interprets as texture, vibration, or temperature.
The upper diagram highlights various receptors, such as Merkel cells, which are fine touch receptors, and Pacinian corpuscles, which detect vibrations. We also see Ruffini endings that respond to skin stretch and free nerve endings that perceive pain and temperature changes.
Beneath, we see an expanded view of free nerve endings. These are the most abundant types of nerve endings in our skin, branching out into the epidermis. They transmit pain and temperature sensations, which are fundamental to our protective responses.
Through these intricate systems, our body remains in constant communication with the external environment, informing us of potential harm and enabling nuanced interactions with the world around us.
Remember that these receptors work in unison to create our sense of touch.
