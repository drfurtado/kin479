In this illustration, the right horizontal canal responds to a head rotation toward the left. As the head turns left, the endolymph lags and moves to the right relative to the canal. This fluid motion pushes the cupula so that the stereocilia bends away from the kinocilium on the right side, which leads to hyperpolarization and a decrease in the firing rate of the vestibular nerve afferents. The small diagram on the left of the slide reinforces this idea, showing a decrease in impulse frequency (inhibition). 
Meanwhile, the left horizontal canal experiences the opposite effect: its stereocilia are deflected toward the kinocilium and depolarized, increasing the firing rate of those nerve fibers. The brain compares these differential signals from both ears to determine whether a head turn is occurring, in which direction, and how quickly. Understanding this push-pull mechanism in the semicircular canals is essential for interpreting rotational movements and maintaining balance.
