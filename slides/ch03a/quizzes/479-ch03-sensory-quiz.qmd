## Proprioception Definition {.quiz-question}

Proprioception is considered the body's 'sixth sense' because it allows us to understand our position in space without relying on visual input.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Proprioception relies on signals from muscles, joints, and connective tissue to enable confident movement even without visual confirmation."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Proprioception is indeed a 'sixth sense' that provides information about body position and movement through non-visual sensory inputs."}

## Muscle Spindle Function {.quiz-question}

Muscle spindles decrease their firing rate when a muscle stretches and increase their rate when the muscle relaxes.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. This is the opposite of how muscle spindles function."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Muscle spindles actually increase their firing rate (Ia afferent) when the muscle stretches and maintain a constant rate when relaxed."}

## Pacinian Corpuscle Detection {.quiz-question}

Pacinian corpuscles are specialized mechanoreceptors that detect high-frequency vibrations between 100-300 Hz.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Pacinian corpuscles are indeed specialized for detecting fast, 'buzzing' sensations in this frequency range, like those from power tools or electric toothbrushes."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Pacinian corpuscles do specifically detect high-frequency vibrations in the 100-300 Hz range."}

## Ruffini's Corpuscles Location {.quiz-question}

Ruffini's corpuscles are located perpendicular to the skin surface to better detect pressure changes.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Ruffini's corpuscles are actually oriented parallel to the skin surface."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Ruffini's corpuscles lie parallel to the surface of the skin, which allows them to better detect skin stretch and elongation of collagen fibers."}

## Flexion Reflex Response {.quiz-question}

In the flexion reflex, both flexor and extensor muscles in the affected limb contract simultaneously for better protection.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. The flexion reflex involves activation of flexors and inhibition of extensors, not simultaneous contraction."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! The flexion reflex involves activation of flexor muscles and inhibition of extensor muscles to withdraw the limb from danger."}

## Crossed Extensor Reflex {.quiz-question}

The crossed extensor reflex activates extensors in the opposite limb to maintain balance during the flexion reflex.

- [True]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! This reflex activates extensors and inhibits flexors in the opposite leg to support body weight while the affected limb withdraws."}
- [False]{data-explanation="Incorrect. The crossed extensor reflex does activate extensors in the opposite limb to maintain balance during withdrawal."}

## Gamma Motor Neurons {.quiz-question}

Gamma motor neurons directly cause muscle contraction for movement.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Gamma motor neurons contract intrafusal fibers within muscle spindles, not the main muscle fibers."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Gamma motor neurons cause contraction of intrafusal muscle fibers within muscle spindles, affecting sensitivity rather than directly causing movement."}

## Somatosensory Processing {.quiz-question}

The brain processes somatosensory information uniformly across all body regions.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. The brain dedicates different amounts of processing area based on the sensitivity needs of different body regions."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! The brain's somatosensory processing is spatially organized, with larger areas dedicated to regions requiring more sensitivity."}

## Mechanoreceptor Types {.quiz-question}

Different types of mechanoreceptors are redundant and serve the same function in detecting touch and pressure.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. Each type of mechanoreceptor is specialized for detecting different types of sensory information."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! Different mechanoreceptors (Meissner's, Pacinian, Ruffini's) are specialized for different sensations like light touch, vibration, and stretch respectively."}

## Spinal Cord Function {.quiz-question}

The spinal cord's role in reflexes requires conscious control from the brain for all protective responses.

- [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. The spinal cord can facilitate rapid motor responses independent of brain intervention."}
- [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! The spinal cord enables rapid motor responses and postural adjustments through reflexes without requiring conscious brain intervention."}
