How do we control the movements of our bodies? How do we walk, talk, sing, and 
smile? How do we manage to perform on the athletic field, play musical instruments, craft 
tools, and produce works of art? How do we learn to carry out these activities, and why are 
some of us better at them than others? What goes wrong when, through accident or disease, 
our ability to move is impaired? How can movement disabilities be restored or, better yet, 
prevented? And how can machines be made to carry out tasks that most people and animals 
perform effortlessly? 
As this list of questions suggests, understanding the control of body movements can have 
significant effects in a wide range of endeavors. This is hardly surprising given that move-
ments occur in all walks of life. In sports, where moving skillfully is the very essence of 
the activity, an understanding of motor control can permit heightened levels of competition. 
In the fine arts, where performance on stage or in the studio permit self-expression, under-
standing how movements are controlled can enhance the quality of that expression and can 
improve the training that leads to it. In medicine, where paralysis or lack of coordination can 
sabotage the quality of life, rehabilitation can be refined through deeper appreciation of the 
means by which the motor system functions. Finally, at home and in the workplace, where 
machines and other appliances are used, such devices can be made safer and more efficient 
through the application of principles gained through research on human motor control.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The question of how movements are controlled is just one of the questions in this field. 
The other major one is how we maintain stability. Holding an object steady in the face of 
changing wind conditions or while standing in a moving train are tasks that demand sta-
bilization. Without muscular control, such tasks would be impossible. Because stabilization 
as well as movement are the jobs of the system covered here, we refer to that system as the 
motor system, not just the movement system or the stabilization system. 
The word "motor" has a connotation that is worth dismissing immediately. That conno-
tation is machinelike rigidity. Conventional motors churn away monotonously, performing 
the same motions over and over again. By contrast, behavior is endlessly novel, reflecting 
millions of years of evolution in which effective strategies developed for adaptation to ever-
changing conditions. 
If you doubt the sophistication of the motor system, consider the state of robots today. 
These devices embody much of what we know about motor control, but two-legged robots 
can barely walk across uneven surfaces without toppling over. Getting a robot to make a 
bed or fold laundry is out of the question. 
The inability of robots to plan and control physical actions as flexibly as people and ani-
mals do means that people rather than robots are often called upon to perform in dangerous 
situations. Astronauts rather than robots typically carry out repairs in outer space. Beneath 
the earth, miners place themselves at risk as they pick away at unwieldy surfaces to extract 
coal or other minerals. On earth's surface, people defuse mines and sift through rubble after 
earthquakes, floods, or bomb blasts. If we knew how people control their bodies, we could 
endow robots with programs that enable the robots to move as people do and carry out dan-
gerous and boring tasks that people currently do. 
UNDERSTANDING HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL 
What does it mean to understand human motor control? What is to be understood and 
what form should the understanding 
take? The answers to these questions are not as obvi-
ous as they might seem, for under normal circumstances, movement and stability just seem 
to happen. When things work well, it is easy to take them for granted. Indeed, a hallmark of 
skilled performance is that it occurs without the need for attention. When one thinks about 
performance, one's performance often suffers (Wulf, 2007). 
By contrast, in abnormal circumstances, skills may be disrupted. Due to an accident or 
disease, the ability to move or stabilize the body may be impaired. A wide range of move-
ment disorders afflict people, many of which will be discussed in this book. Considering 
these disorders and the factors that cause them can illuminate the factors that allow for nor-
mal performance. That knowledge can in turn contribute to our understanding 
of motor 
control in general. 
What does it mean to understand motor control? One understands 
a system if one can 
predict and control it. We do not fully understand the weather, for example, because we 
cannot predict it, except at a gross level, and we cannot control the weather in any practical 
sense. On the other hand, we understand aeronautics well enough that we entrust our lives 
to airplanes traveling at breakneck speeds and at dizzying heights.

UNDERSTANDING HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL 
3 
Virtually all neurologically normal individuals can control their movements reasonably 
well, but none of these individuals can say in detail how they achieve that control. Most 
adults can ride a bicycle, for example, but none can say how they do so. Even Albert Einstein 
would have had to think for a while before saying how he managed to cycle. 
The fact that the principles of motor control cannot be easily articulated does not mean 
they can never be verbally expressed. The method for riding a bicycle has been written 
down: 
The rule observed by the cyclist is this. When he starts falling to the right he turns the handlebars to the 
right so that the course of the bicycle is deflected along a curve toward the right. This results in a centrifugal 
force pushing the cyclist to the left and offsets the gravitational force dragging him down to the right. This 
maneuver presently throws the cyclist out of balance to the left, which he counteracts by turning the han-
dlebars to the left; and so he continues to keep himself in balance by winding along a series of appropriate 
curvatures. A simple analysis shows that for a given angle of unbalance the curvature of each winding is 
inversely proportional to the square of the speed at which the cyclist is proceeding [Polanyi, 1964, 49-50]. 
It is unlikely that Einstein drew on a verbal proposition like this one. The form of knowl-
edge he probably relied on, and the form of knowledge that the rest of us use, is tacit or 
implicit knowledge (Polanyi, 1964). 
By seeing that the knowledge underlying bike riding and other motor activities can be 
verbalized, we see that understanding 
motor control involves being able to state the prin-
ciples of motor control. Ultimately, a theory of motor control will have to be expressed in a 
form that lets the theory be communicated in books such as this one and in scientific articles. 
In other words, it will have to verbalized. What form should that verbalized theory take? 
It is possible to demonstrate one's understanding of a system by simulating it. In the case 
of motor control, such a demonstration can take the form of a robot that moves in a way 
that is indistinguishable from the way neurologically normal people do. Such a robot would 
pass the Turing test of motor intelligence. The term Turing test re.fers to a method of judg-
ing intelligence. The test was developed by Alan Turing, a mathematician and philosopher 
who helped crack the secret code used by the Nazis in World War II. Turing proposed a test 
for understanding verbally expressed intelligence. In the test, a human participant-call 
her 
Elana-interacts 
with a computer or with another person via a keyboard and display. The 
critical feature of the setup is that Elana does not know "vith whom she is dealing, a person 
or a computer. Based on the interactions, she tries to determine whether the individual is a 
computer or a person. If Elana cannot tell that she is interacting with a computer though her 
correspondent is in fact a machine, one can say that the designer of the computer succeeded 
in designing a machine that is as intelligent as a person. A Turing test of motor intelligence 
would work in similar ways. If Elana watched a robot dancing and thought it was a human 
being, she could say the designer of the dancing robot had captured, and truly understood, 
the control of dance. 
Are we near such a demonstration? Humanoid robots developed by Mitsuo Kawato and 
his colleagues at the ATR Laboratories in Japan come close to passing the Turing test. One 
of those robots is shown in Figure 1.1. The robot shown in this figure can play air hockey 
as well as most people can. Even more interestingly, it does so in a way that is amazingly 
lifelike. If you find and watch a video of this robot on the world-wide web, be mindful that 
the person playing against the robot can do something the robot can't. The person can walk 
away, stroll down the hall, and, if he hears a child crying out for help in a room he passes, he

can enter the room and pull the child out from the shelf and pile of books that have landed 
on him when he decided to climb up on his mother's bookcase. The robot, by contrast, can 
do just what it was programmed to do and no more. 
LEVELS OF ANALYSIS 
Reflecting on the air-hockey-playing robot, you might say that the lifelike performance 
of this robot is of only moderate interest, for human beings are made of flesh and blood, 
whereas robots, or at least robots like the air-hockey-playing robot shown in Figure 1.1, are 
made of synthetic materials. Doesn't that difference make the comparison between people 
and robots irrelevant to the understanding of human motor control? 
The fact that one actor is real and the other is not does not mean that similarities between 
them are irrelevant. Apart from the fact that it is fun to watch a machine behave as people 
do, the deeper reason why robots and people are worth comparing is that different levels 
of analysis characterize the study of human motor control. Understanding 
these levels of 
analysis helps us appreciate why it useful to compare robots to people and animals. 
David Marr (1982) proposed three levels of understanding 
for the study of such systems. 
One level of analysis that Marr identified was the computational level. This level, according 
to Marr, consists of a description, often expressed mathematically, of one or more functions 
that a system is supposed to achieve. The cartoon in Figure 1.2 illustrates the computational 
level. Here a cat prepares to jump onto a table. At some level, the cat's planning can be rep-
resented in equations and diagrams of the sorts that physicists write, although of course 
the cat does not explicitly use such equations anymore than people do, or, presumably, any

more than Einstein did when he rode his bicycle or carried out other physical activities. 
Even if equations are not used explicitly, they are used implicitly in performance. The compu-
tational level of analysis is concerned with those implicit equations. 
How the cat actually jumps onto the table is left out of the computational description. 
The cat might crouch, leap up, prepare to land, and then use its sense of touch to check that 
it has landed. These behavioral and cognitive states constitute the second of Marr's levels, 
what can be called the procedural level. This term is used because it concerns events that 
occur in real time. (Marr actually used the term algorithmic level, but algorithms are guar-
anteed to work. Not all procedures do; getting a basketball to go through a net is not a sure 
thing, though it relies on a procedure.) 
The third of Marr's levels is the implementation level. Here what counts is the physical 
stuff that permits procedures to be physically achieved. In the case of the jumping cat, the 
questions relevant to the implementation 
level are how muscles contract and relax, which 
brain regions become active or inactive, and so on. If the cat were robotic rather than mam-
malian, the relevant issues would be how the hydraulics of the actuators should be used, 
how the robot's battery power should be drawn on, and so on. 
Having identified the three levels in Marr's triptych-the 
computational level, the pro-
cedural level, and the implementation level-we 
can now ask "vhich of those three levels is 
most important in the study of human motor control. One way to address this question is to 
ask what would happen if any of the levels were excluded. 
If the implementation level were excluded, most medical conditions involving motor con-
trol would be forgotten. No one would want that to happen, of course. We want advances in 
motor control to help people overcome motor-control difficulties.

I. INTRODUCTION 
If the algorithmic level were excluded, most studies of effective training procedures would 
be left by the wayside, as would research in the field of human factors-designing 
safer 
roads, smarter computer interfaces, and so on. Again, this is not what one would want. 
Finally, if the computational level were excluded, most efforts to advance robotics would 
be abandoned. This, too, would be undesirable, for even if you have qualms about robots-
perhaps you feel they will take over the jobs of too many people-computational 
work is 
of great importance. Thus, the understanding 
of human motor control requires work at all 
three levels. No level is more important than any other. All of the levels should be pursued 
and respected. 
FIELDS CONTRIBUTING TO RESEARCH 
ON HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL 
If all three levels of analysis contribute to the understanding of human motor control, one 
would expect fields that pursue any of the levels to contribute to this field of study. This is 
indeed the case, making human motor control a truly interdisciplinary area. 
Physics 
As mentioned earlier, physics plays a key role in the study of human motor control. This 
makes sense, considering that there are physical constraints on what we can do. We can only 
jump so high, run so fast, push so hard, and so on. Physics helps determine the factors that 
limit performance. 
Physics can also indicate the factors that enable performance. A skillful baseball batter can 
learn how to use the momentum of her bat to maximize the force she exerts on the oncom-
ing ball, and she can learn to hit the ball on the bat's "sweet spot," where bounce-back is 
maximized. Similarly, a cat preparing to jump onto a table can learn how to drop on its 
haunches before leaping up, exploiting elastic energy (Alexander, 1992). 
Engineering 
The computational style of analysis used by physicists in their theoretical work has also 
been used by engineers in their applied work. Men and women in engineering use physical 
principles to solve practical problems such as designing bridges that don't fall or designing 
computers that don't forget. Engineers also work on issues related to motor control such as 
robotics and prostheses (artificial appendages used by amputees). 
One issue that engineers have worked on a great deal is how to use feedback effectively. 
Feedback is crucial for effective motor control, whether the performance entails standing on 
a moving train, chasing a fly ball, or driving an automobile. The approach to the analysis of 
feedback that engineers have developed is called control theory.

Statistics 
If you take a pencil and move the tip back and forth as quickly as possible between two 
target points, always lifting the pencil between the hits, you will end up with a cloud of 
points near each target. These clouds show that, despite your best intentions, your perform-
ance is not perfect. No one's is. Everyone's performance is variable to some degree. 
The study of variability as well as other features of data is the focus of statistics. Some 
important recent advances in the understanding 
of human motor control have been made 
possible through the application of statistics to motor control research. 
Behavioral Science, Cognitive Science, and Human Factors 
Researchers who study the procedural level of human motor control work in the fields of 
behavioral science, cognitive science, and human factors. Behavioral scientists study overt 
physical activity to predict and, on occasion, control behavior. Cognitive scientists are also 
interested in the procedural level, but are especially interested in the internal processes that 
allow behavior to unfold. Cognitive scientists often say they are interested in the software 
that makes behavior possible. Human factors specialists are interested in the applications of 
behavioral and cognitive science to practical problems such as desi.gning easy-to-understand 
road signs, easy-to-use computer interfaces, and easy-to-manipulate 
hand tools. Scientists in 
these fields work in academic departments, 
such as departments 
of psychology, industrial 
engineering, physical education, or kinesiology, or in companies or governmental agencies. 
Chapter 4 provides an overview of behavioral science, cognitive science, and human factors 
approaches to human motor control. 
Physiology, Neuroscience, Medicine, and Allied Fields 
People who study the implementation level of motor control in biological systems are most 
often associated with physiology. Physiologists interested in motor control focus on mus-
cle, bones, and joints, as well as the main regulator of muscle activity, the nervous system, 
which is the province of neuroscience. The practitioners who apply this information in the 
clinic are neurologists (who diagnose and treat ailments of the nervous system), orthopedists 
(who diagnose and treat disorders of bones and joints), physical therapists (who help restore 
motion and stability through behavioral rehabilitation), and prostheticians (who craft and fit 
artificial limbs for people with amputations). Rudiments of physiology, neuroscience, medi-
cine, and allied fields that pertain to human motor control will be presented in Chapter 3. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK 
This book has three main parts. The first is introductory. It contains, besides this chap-
ter, Chapter 2 (Core Problems), Chapter 3 (Physiological Foundations), 
and Chapter 4 
(Psychological Foundations).

I. INTRODUCTION 
The second part is organized by activity. Within it, Chapter 5 is concerned with walk-
ing and related forms of locomotion. Chapter 6 is concerned with looking, or more specifi-
cally, the control of eye and head movements. Chapter 7 focuses on reaching and grasping. 
Chapter 8 treats the control of drawing and writing. Chapter 9 covers keyboarding (i.e., the 
control of typewriting, text-messaging, piano playing, and other finger-movement 
tasks). 
Chapter 10 covers the control of speaking and singing. Chapter 11, the last chapter in Part II, 
is concerned with smiling and other forms of facial expression. 
The third part of the book has a single chapter, Moving On. This chapter presents new 
advances and new challenges that newcomers to the field may wisih to take up. 
You should know why the book is organized as it is and why the book has the title it has. 
Regarding organization, and in particular the devotion of much of the book to distinct activ-
ities (Chapters 5-11), this approach has several advantages. One is that research in motor 
control, like research in most fields today, has become specialized. It is not really a carica-
ture of the field to say that there are people who work entirely on eye movements, others 
who work entirely on reaching and grasping, others who work entirely on speech, and so 
forth. The proliferation of subspecialties within motor-control research derives partly from 
the practical and theoretical interests of workers in the field. Practical concerns with particu-
lar tasks sometimes compel investigators to pursue particular task domains at the expense 
of others. A researcher working for a computer company, for example, is likely to be more 
interested in keyboarding than in singing. Theoretical interests also place some investigators 
on circumscribed research paths. Students of vision, for example, are naturally more inter-
ested in oculomotor (eye movement) control than in speech. 
The second reason for devoting separate chapters to separate activities is that many of 
the specialty areas have developed their own problems and methodologies. The twists and 
turns in one area do not always map easily onto the lines of study in another area, so rather 
than risk losing the richness of particular areas of study, each area is paid its due by being 
considered on its own. 
In treating the subsystems separately, it is critical that the treatment not become too 
parochial. Areas of common concern need to be highlighted, as does work on the coor-
dination of different motor tasks. Being on the lookout for similarities between the motor 
subsystems puts one in an advantageous 
position for detecting differences between them. 
That there might be differences is a real and intriguing possibility, given that some proc-
esses may be controlled by independent modules with their own rules of operation (Fodor, 
1983). If modularity applies to the motor system, different motor activities might be con-
trolled in wholly different ways. Treating the motor activities separately makes it possible 
to identify those differences if they exist or note their absence if they might otherwise be 
expected. 
Regarding the title of the book, Human Motor Control, many but not all of the activities 
that are discussed here can be carried out only by people, but many of the activities can 
also be carried out by non-human animals. The word "human" is included in the title even 
though animal research is discussed throughout the volume. Animal work is important to 
the understanding of human motor control (and vice versa). 
The use of the term "motor control" also requires justification, for one might wonder 
whether there really is a system responsible for motor activity, separate from other systems
