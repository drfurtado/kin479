::: notes
At the computational level, we try to understand the mathematical principles behind movement control. This involves breaking down complex movements into their fundamental components and understanding the calculations our nervous system performs.

Think about catching a ball. Your brain needs to:
- Calculate the ball's trajectory
- Estimate where and when it will arrive
- Plan the movement of your hand
- Adjust the movement based on visual feedback

These calculations happen automatically and almost instantaneously. Understanding how our nervous system performs these computations helps us:
- Develop better rehabilitation strategies
- Create more natural robotic movements
- Improve sports training techniques

::: notes
The implementation level focuses on how our nervous system actually executes movement commands. This involves understanding the complex interactions between our brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles.

When we look at implementation, we're examining:
- How motor neurons fire
- How muscles contract in sequence
- How sensory feedback is processed
- How the brain adapts to changes

This knowledge is crucial for:
- Understanding movement disorders
- Developing neural prosthetics
- Improving rehabilitation techniques

::: notes
Movement disorders provide important insights into how motor control works. By studying what happens when the system malfunctions, we learn more about normal function.

Key aspects we study include:
- How different disorders affect movement
- What compensatory strategies people develop
- Which treatments are most effective
- How rehabilitation can be optimized

This research helps us:
- Develop better treatments
- Create more effective rehabilitation programs
- Understand normal motor control better

</div>

::: notes
The physics of movement becomes particularly interesting when we look at complex activities. For instance, when you're maintaining balance while standing in a moving train, you're dealing with multiple physical forces: gravity pulling you down, inertia trying to keep you in place, and the train's acceleration pushing you in different directions. Your motor system has to constantly calculate and adjust to these forces.
