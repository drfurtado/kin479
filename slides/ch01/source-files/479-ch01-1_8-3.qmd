::: notes
How do we express and share knowledge about motor control? This is a crucial question in our field. We need ways to communicate complex ideas about movement that are both scientifically accurate and practically useful.

The expression of motor control knowledge takes many forms:
- Scientific papers and research
- Clinical guidelines
- Teaching materials
- Practical demonstrations

This knowledge helps us:
- Develop better teaching methods
- Create more effective treatments
- Advance research in the field
