Experimental methods in motor control research require careful planning and precise execution. We need to consider:
- How to isolate specific aspects of movement
- What measurements are most relevant
- How to control for confounding variables
- How to ensure reliability and validity

The choice of methods affects:
- The quality of our data
- The strength of our conclusions
- The applicability of our findings
