::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The structured planning of motor control studies, including selection of variables, control measures, and appropriate measurement techniques.
:::

## Demonstration Learning

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Demonstration Learning
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The process of learning motor skills through observation and replication of demonstrated movements, incorporating visual and cognitive processing.

## Pattern Recognition

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Pattern Recognition
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The ability to identify and understand recurring movement patterns and their variations in motor control tasks.
:::

## Learning Progression

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Learning Progression
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The systematic stages through which motor skills are acquired, from initial understanding to automated execution.
:::

## Adaptation Studies

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Adaptation Studies
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: Research examining how individuals modify their movements in response to changes in task demands or environmental conditions.
