## Computational Level Analysis

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Computational Level Analysis
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The mathematical and theoretical study of how the nervous system processes information to produce movement, including modeling of neural computations and movement planning.
:::

## Neural Networks

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Neural Networks
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: Interconnected networks of neurons that process and transmit information for movement control, serving as both biological systems and computational models.
:::

## Control Theory

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Control Theory
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}

:::

## Sensory Integration

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Sensory Integration
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The process of combining information from multiple sensory systems to guide and adjust movement control and coordination.
:::

## Movement Disorders

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: Movement Disorders
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: Neurological conditions that affect the control, quality, and execution of movement, providing insights into normal motor control function.
:::
