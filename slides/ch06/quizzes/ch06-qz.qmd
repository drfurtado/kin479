The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) helps stabilize vision during head movements by moving the eyes in the same direction as the head.

-   [True]{data-explanation="Incorrect. The last step is the compensatory eye movement, known as the vestibulo-ocular reflex."}
-   [False]{.correct data-explanation="Correct! The VOR compensates for head motion by causing counter-motion of the eyes."}
