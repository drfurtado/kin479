:::

## Parkinson's Disease - Basal Ganglia {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: How is Parkinson's disease related to the basal ganglia?
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: Parkinson's disease involves **decreased functioning of the substantia nigra** within the basal ganglia, leading to a **decrease in dopamine** and impaired movement.
:::

## Motor Cortex - Function {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: What is the primary function of the motor cortex?
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: The motor cortex is responsible for **voluntary control of movement**, including **force and coordination of muscle action**. It is spatially mapped to different body regions.
:::

## Motor Cortex - Hemispheres {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: How do the brain's hemispheres control the body?
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: One hemisphere of the motor cortex controls the opposite side of the body.
:::

## Stroke - Motor Cortex {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: How does a stroke affect motor function?
:::

::: {.flashcard-back}
Definition: A stroke, or lack of blood flow to the brain, can affect the motor cortex, often resulting in **hemiparesis** (one-sided paralysis).
:::

## Premotor Cortex - Function {.flashcard}

::: {.flashcard-front}
Term: What is the role of the premotor cortex (PMC)?
