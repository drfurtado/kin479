Welcome to KIN 479: Motor Control! This course delves deep into both foundational and applied aspects of human motor control, exploring how humans control movement across their lifespan. We take an integrated approach to understanding human movement, with special emphasis on examining the perception-action loop - the intricate links between sensation, cognition, and movement.

Throughout this course, you'll first gain foundational knowledge in motor control, including sensory and motor physiology and theories of motor control. Then, you'll learn to apply this knowledge to better understand motor control in various movements. Additionally, you'll explore the current state of motor control through recent applied research in relevant areas.

The material you'll learn in this course has broad applications - whether you're interested in rehabilitation, clinical practice, sport, or research. Our required textbook is the second edition of Human Motor Control by David A. Rosenbaum, which will guide us through these concepts.

I think you'll find this course both challenging and incredibly rewarding, especially if you're interested in understanding how we control our movements and how we can help others improve theirs.
