# Course Description

Welcome to Motor Control, a course that delves deep into foundational and applied aspects of human motor control. This is done through an integrated approach to the nature of human movement across the life span, with special emphasis on examining the perception-action loop, or the links between sensation, cognition, and movement. In this course, students will first gain foundational knowledge in motor control, including sensory and motor physiology and theories of motor control. Then they will apply this knowledge to better understand motor control of a variety of movements. Additionally, they will gain knowledge on the current state of motor control through reporting on recent applied research in a relevant area. The material learned from this course can be applied to a variety of future careers that involve rehabilitation, clinical practice, sport, and research.

-   Foundational knowledge in motor control, sensory and motor physiology, and related theories.\
-   Applications to rehabilitation, clinical practice, sport, and research.\
-   Engagement with recent applied research in motor control.

**Required Textbook**:\
Rosenbaum, D. A. *Human Motor Control* (2nd Edition).

::: callout-important
The required course text is the second edition of Human Motor Control by David A. Rosenbaum. Reading assignments should be done first, prior to starting other course-related tasks for the week. Your reading for the week is posted below. This course will be delivered through Canvas. All materials, grades, and discussions will be accessed through this site. Therefore, please take the time to familiarize yourself with the course pages during the first week of the course. Also, Microsoft Office is required, as we will discuss material through PowerPoint presentations, and some assignments require Excel.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Each learning objective for this course targets one or more of the Department of Kinesiology’s Student Learning Outcomes. The department website provides a complete description of these Outcomes.
By the end of this course, students will be able to: 

- Describe different approaches to understanding motor control, including dynamical systems and other, more traditional approaches SLO 1, 4
- Apply foundational knowledge of sensorimotor structure and function to motor control applications SLO 1, 2
- Describe theories that frame and describe motor control SLO 1, 2
- Use articles to establish evidence-based approaches to designing exercises that influence motor control SLO 1, 3, 4
- Understand, interpret, and critique current motor control articles on different topics. SLO 3, 4
- Reflect on how historical concepts can influence the theories of motor control and action SLO 2, 4


# Course Format and Attendance

This course will be delivered entirely online. All materials for a given week will be posted by 5:00 PM each Monday, and each set of posted materials is intended to cover an entire week. Each week’s materials will have an associated page on the Canvas site. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the asynchronous online format and learn and digest the materials at their own pace. Any assignments given for a week will be due the Monday after they are assigned. Therefore, students should review all material for the week, complete any activities, quizzes, and projects for the week, and submit them before the deadline. Lectures will be posted weekly to accompany the reading material. 

No attendance will be taken for this course, and no participation points will be given. Due to its mostly asynchronous nature, students have the freedom to learn at their own pace and demonstrate their knowledge of the material through the quality of their assignments.

# Communication, Sexual Misconduct Disclosures, and Respectful Environment

Proper communication etiquette is essential for fostering a respectful learning environment. Please:

-   Use clear and respectful language in emails and discussion posts.
-   Be mindful of diverse perspectives and identities.

**Sexual Misconduct Disclosures**:

One of your instructor’s responsibilities is to help maintain a respectful learning environment. If a student chooses to write, speak, or otherwise disclose about having experienced sexual misconduct/sexual violence, including rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking and specifies that this violence occurred while they or the perpetrator were a CSUN student, federal and state laws require that the instructor, as a “responsible employee,” notify our campus Title IX coordinator.

**CSUN Title IX Coordinator**: Barrett Morris ([barrett.morris\@csun.edu](mailto:barrett.morris@csun.edu))\
**Campus Care Advocate**: (818) 677-4972\
