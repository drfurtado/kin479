## Overview

In this group presentation assignment, you will choose a specific movement disorder and create a slide presentation covering the following aspects:

-   Neurophysiology/pathophysiology
-   Skill performance
-   Treatment (PT, medication, etc.)
-   Overall outlook

## Group Instructions

1.  Choose one movement disorder from the list of topics ([Appendix A: Topics]) provided or select another relevant disorder.
2.  Create a slide presentation addressing the required content areas (see [Appendix B: Presentation Template]).
3.  Record a group presentation of your slides, ensuring that each group member participates.
4.  Submissions:
    1.  Topic submission
        1.  The `group's leader` submits three topics for consideration by **Feb 10 \@ 5pm**.
        2.  The instructor selects a topic and notifies the group
    2.  Video Recording (70 points)
        1.  The `group's leader` submits the recorded presentation (under Discussion) by **April 14 \@ 5pm**.
    3.  Peer Evaluation
        1.  Everyone submits a peer evaluation by **May 13 \@ 5 pm.**
    4.  Peer Engagement (extra credit)
        1.  `Everyone` watches other groups' presentation videos, formulates questions, and submits them to the `group's leader` **before April 21**.
            1.  The `group's leader` chooses no more than 5 questions and posts them to their respective submissions (#4.2 above) by **April 28 \@ 5pm**.
