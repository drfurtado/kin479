This “enactive cognition” view emphasizes that our thoughts and feelings are deeply linked to our physical actions.\nExamples include: - Counting performance is impaired when pointing is prevented - Walking variability and body sway increase during demanding cognitive tasks - Pendulum swinging and reaction times are affected by cognitive states\nIn addition to these overt manifestations, more subtle changes in motor states also accompany cognition, such as the dynamics of ongoing movement reflecting the time course of information processing.\nThese findings highlight the rich interplay between mental processes and motor behavior, challenging the traditional separation between thinking and doing."

Studies show that:\n\nKinematic features of movement can convey emotional activation, if not valence\nEmotional stress can disrupt motor performance and may contribute to chronic pain conditions\n\nDespite a long history of thought about the relation between motion and emotion (e.g., Darwin’s work on emotional expressions), there has been surprisingly little modern research on this topic from a motor control perspective.\nUnderstanding these emotion-motion links has important implications for optimizing performance under pressure, treating clinical disorders involving emotionally-triggered motor symptoms, and appreciating the embodied nature of emotional experience."

Theories are general principles, hypotheses are conjectures about specific situations, models are detailed mathematical instantiations, and predictions are forecasts that can be tested. The hypothetico-deductive method involves deriving predictions from theories and hypotheses and then empirically testing those predictions."

It suggests that the motor system has access to a form of implicit knowledge or computation that is not always available to conscious reasoning.\nUnderstanding the nature and origins of this motor intelligence remains an important challenge for ongoing research, with implications for both theory and application."

    "text": "Isn’t it fascinating how our brain manages to control our movements with such precision? The cognitive science perspective on motor control reveals the remarkable complexity of the decision-making and problem-solving processes involved in even seemingly simple movements.\nWhat makes this particularly interesting is that most of our movement control happens without conscious thought. Think about it - when you’re walking while having a conversation, you’re not actively thinking about lifting your feet or maintaining balance. Your cognitive system is handling these complex motor tasks automatically, leaving your conscious mind free to focus on the conversation.\nThis automatic processing is a result of sophisticated cognitive mechanisms that have evolved to handle movement efficiently. Your brain is constantly processing sensory information, making split-second decisions, and adjusting your movements in real-time. For example, when you’re reaching for a cup, your brain is simultaneously processing visual information about the cup’s location, planning the movement path, and preparing your muscles for the appropriate force needed to lift it.\nUnderstanding these cognitive processes is crucial for many applications. In rehabilitation, it helps therapists design better strategies for retraining movement after injury. In sports, it aids in developing more effective training methods. And in human-computer interaction, it helps create more intuitive interfaces that work with our natural cognitive processes rather than against them."

The field of motor control uses a fascinating array of experimental methods that combine cutting-edge technology with careful scientific observation. Let me share some of the exciting ways we investigate movement.\nOne of our most powerful tools is motion capture technology - similar to what’s used in making movies and video games. But instead of creating entertainment, we use it to track movement with millimeter precision. Imagine being able to see exactly how a professional athlete’s body moves during a perfect serve in tennis, or how a pianist’s fingers dance across the keys. This technology lets us break down these complex movements into their smallest components.\nWe also use sophisticated equipment like EMG sensors that detect the electrical signals in your muscles, showing us exactly when and how strongly each muscle activates. Combined with force plates that measure the pressures and forces during movement, and eye-tracking devices that show where people look while performing tasks, we get a complete picture of how the body coordinates movement.\nBut perhaps most fascinating is how we study the brain during movement. Using techniques like fMRI and EEG, we can actually see which parts of the brain are active when planning and executing movements. This helps us understand the incredible neural choreography behind even the simplest actions, like reaching for a cup or maintaining balance while walking."

    "text": "Have you ever wondered how scientists make sense of the complex ways our brain controls movement? This is where computational analysis comes in, using mathematical models to understand the intricate processes of motor control.\nOne fascinating aspect of motor control is that while most of us can perform complex movements easily, we can’t explicitly explain how we do it. Take riding a bicycle, for example. Even brilliant minds like Albert Einstein would have needed time to explain the physics behind cycling! This is because much of our motor knowledge is tacit or implicit - we know how to do it, but we can’t easily put it into words.\nHowever, through computational analysis, researchers have been able to break down these complex movements into understandable components. For instance, the mathematics of bicycle riding involves maintaining balance by making continuous adjustments: when falling to one side, you turn the handlebars in that direction, creating a centrifugal force that counteracts gravity. The curvature of each correction is actually inversely proportional to the square of your speed!\nThis type of mathematical and computational analysis helps us understand not just how we move, but also how we learn new movements and why some people are better at certain motor tasks than others. It’s led to groundbreaking discoveries in fields like neurology and robotics, showing us just how remarkable our motor control system really is."

This practical aspect of motor control knowledge is crucial because movement is inherently about doing rather than just knowing.\nThink about it this way: you can read about how to ride a bicycle all day long, but until you actually get on a bike and try it, you won’t really understand the complex interplay of balance, coordination, and control involved. This is because motor skills involve what we call “tacit knowledge” - knowledge that’s difficult to verbalize but essential for actual performance.\nWhat’s fascinating is how theoretical understanding and practical demonstration work together.

It’s called the Turing test for motor intelligence, and it’s based on a simple but powerful idea: if a robot can move so naturally that you can’t tell it apart from a human, we’ve achieved a deep understanding of human motor control.\nThis concept comes from Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician who helped crack Nazi codes during World War II. While the original Turing test was about verbal intelligence, the motor version focuses on movement. Imagine watching a robot perform a task - if you can’t tell whether it’s a robot or a human moving, that robot has passed the motor Turing test.\nCurrent robotics gives us a humbling perspective on human motor control. Take the example of humanoid robots playing air hockey - while they can match human performance in this specific task, they’re still far from matching our general movement capabilities. A human can walk away from the air hockey table, navigate through a building, and respond to unexpected situations, while the robot remains limited to its programmed task.\nThis limitation of current robots highlights just how sophisticated human motor control really is. Our ability to adapt to new situations, learn new movements, and seamlessly coordinate complex actions is still far beyond what we can program into machines. Each advance in robotics not only brings us closer to more capable machines but also deepens our appreciation for the remarkable capabilities of human motor control."

This highlights a fascinating aspect of motor knowledge - the difference between being able to do something and being able to explain it.\nConsider this: most adults can ride a bicycle, but very few can explain the physics and motor control principles that make it possible. Even brilliant scientists would need time to articulate exactly how they maintain balance while cycling. This is because much of our motor knowledge is tacit or implicit - we know how to do it, but we can’t easily put it into words.\nHowever, being able to express motor control knowledge verbally is crucial for several reasons. In teaching and coaching, clear communication helps transfer skills more effectively. In research, we need to be able to describe and share our understanding of motor control principles. And in clinical settings, being able to explain movement patterns helps in diagnosis and treatment.\nThe challenge lies in bridging the gap between practical motor knowledge and theoretical understanding. This is why motor control experts work to develop clear, precise language for describing movement, while also recognizing that some aspects of motor learning will always remain in the realm of practical experience rather than verbal instruction."

    "text": "Have you ever wondered about the incredible machinery behind our ability to move? At the implementation level, we’re looking at the actual physical and biological mechanisms that make movement possible.\nThis level of analysis is fascinating because it reveals the complex interplay between different systems in our body. Your nervous system, muscles, and skeletal structure all work together in perfect harmony to produce even the simplest movements. Think about picking up a cup of coffee - this seemingly simple action involves precise coordination between your visual system, brain, spinal cord, and numerous muscles in your arm and hand.\nWhat’s particularly remarkable is how these biological systems achieve something that even our most advanced robots struggle to replicate. While robots can perform precise, pre-programmed movements, they lack the natural fluidity and adaptability that comes from our biological implementation. This biological system has evolved over millions of years to handle an endless variety of situations and tasks.\nUnderstanding the implementation level is crucial for medical applications. When something goes wrong with movement, whether through injury or disease, knowing how the system is implemented helps doctors and therapists target their treatments more effectively. It’s also vital for developing better assistive technologies that can work in harmony with our natural biological systems."

    "text": "Did you know that physics plays a fundamental role in understanding how we move? It’s true! Every movement we make is governed by physical laws and constraints that determine what’s possible and what isn’t.\nThink about it - there are clear physical limits to what our bodies can do. We can only jump so high, run so fast, or push so hard. These limitations aren’t just about our muscles or training; they’re about the basic physics of force, motion, and energy. Understanding these physical principles helps us grasp why certain movements are possible while others aren’t.\nThe physics of movement becomes particularly interesting when we look at complex activities. For instance, when you’re maintaining balance while standing in a moving train, you’re dealing with multiple physical forces: gravity pulling you down, inertia trying to keep you in place, and the train’s acceleration pushing you in different directions. Your motor system has to constantly calculate and adjust to these forces, even though you’re not consciously aware of doing these calculations.\nThis knowledge of physics in motor control has practical applications too. In sports training, understanding the physics of movement can help athletes optimize their performance. In rehabilitation, it helps therapists design more effective treatment strategies. And in everyday life, it helps us design better equipment and environments that work with our natural movement patterns rather than against them."

    "text": "Have you ever watched animals move and wondered what they could teach us about human movement? Animal research provides fascinating insights into the fundamental mechanisms of motor control that we share with our fellow creatures on Earth.\nWhat makes animal research so valuable is that many basic movement mechanisms are preserved across species. By studying how animals move, learn new movements, and adapt to different situations, we can better understand the core principles of motor control. This is particularly useful because animals often allow us to study movement in ways that wouldn’t be possible or ethical with human subjects.\nThe applications of this research are quite remarkable. For instance, studying how birds maintain balance during flight has helped us understand human balance control. Research on how animals recover from injuries has led to better rehabilitation strategies for humans. And observations of animal movement efficiency have inspired improvements in robotic design and human movement techniques.\nBut perhaps most fascinating is how animal research reveals the evolutionary aspects of motor control. Many of our movement capabilities are built on neural and muscular systems that evolved over millions of years. Understanding this evolutionary history helps explain why our movement control systems work the way they do, and why certain movement patterns seem to come naturally while others require more conscious effort."

    "text": "Have you ever noticed how no two movements are exactly the same, even when performing the same action? This natural variability in human movement is actually a fascinating aspect of motor control that tells us a lot about how our motor system works.\nUnlike rigid machines that perform identical movements repeatedly, human movement shows endless variety and adaptability. This variability isn’t a flaw - it’s a feature that evolved over millions of years, allowing us to adapt to ever-changing conditions in our environment. When you think about it, this adaptability is quite remarkable. Whether you’re walking on different surfaces, catching a ball in varying wind conditions, or adjusting your grip strength for different objects, your motor system is constantly making subtle adjustments.\nWhat’s particularly interesting is how this variability changes with skill level. In some cases, more skilled performers show less variability in certain aspects of movement, while maintaining flexibility in others. This balance between consistency and adaptability is a hallmark of skilled motor performance.\nUnderstanding movement variability has important practical applications too. In rehabilitation, it helps therapists distinguish between normal movement variations and problematic irregularities. In sports training, coaches can use this knowledge to help athletes develop more consistent yet adaptable movement patterns."

    "text": "Did you know that every movement you make involves an incredibly complex dance between your brain and muscles? The field of neuroscience helps us understand this fascinating connection between our nervous system and movement control.\nWhen you think about it, it’s amazing how your brain can coordinate countless muscles to perform precise movements. Whether you’re threading a needle or catching a ball, your nervous system is processing information and sending signals at lightning speed. This intricate brain-muscle interaction involves multiple areas of the brain, the spinal cord, and a vast network of nerves throughout your body.\nWhat’s particularly fascinating is how the nervous system handles both planned and reactive movements. When you decide to reach for a cup, your brain plans the movement in advance. But if the cup suddenly starts to tip, your nervous system can trigger corrective movements faster than you can consciously think about them. This combination of planned and reactive control makes our movement system incredibly versatile and efficient.\nUnderstanding these neural mechanisms isn’t just academically interesting - it has important practical applications. In rehabilitation medicine, this knowledge helps develop better treatments for movement disorders. In sports training, it informs techniques for improving motor skills. And in the development of neural prosthetics, it guides the creation of devices that can interface directly with the nervous system."

This powerful tool helps scientists understand patterns in movement that might not be visible to the naked eye.\nStatistics plays a crucial role in motor control research because human movement naturally varies from one attempt to the next. Even skilled performers never make exactly the same movement twice. By using statistical methods, researchers can distinguish between normal variability and significant changes in performance. This helps us understand what aspects of movement are most important for successful performance.\nThe applications of statistics in motor control research are incredibly diverse. From analyzing the development of fine motor skills in children to studying the effects of aging on movement, statistical tools help reveal patterns and relationships that would otherwise remain hidden. For instance, statistical analysis can show how practice affects performance, how different movement strategies compare in effectiveness, or how various factors like fatigue or stress impact motor control.\nWhat’s particularly exciting is how modern statistical techniques, combined with advanced measurement technologies, are giving us unprecedented insights into human movement. These tools are helping us better understand not just how we move, but also how we learn new movements and how we can optimize performance in various tasks."

Engineers bring their unique problem-solving approaches to help us understand and improve human movement.\nThe relationship between engineering and motor control is particularly evident when we look at robotics. Current robots embody much of what we know about motor control, yet they still struggle with tasks that humans find simple. For example, two-legged robots can barely walk across uneven surfaces without toppling over, and tasks like making a bed or folding laundry remain beyond their capabilities.\nThis limitation of robots highlights just how sophisticated human motor control is. In dangerous situations, like space repairs, mining operations, or disaster recovery, we often still rely on humans rather than robots because of our superior motor control abilities. Engineers are working to bridge this gap, studying human movement to develop better robotic systems that could eventually take over these hazardous tasks.\nThe engineering approach to motor control also contributes to the development of assistive technologies. By understanding how humans move and control their bodies, engineers can create more effective devices to help people with movement disabilities. This combination of biomechanics, electrical engineering, and computer science is transforming lives through innovative solutions."

This procedural level of analysis helps us understand how our motor system handles these real-time adaptations.\nWhat’s particularly fascinating is how our brain processes these adjustments without conscious thought.

However, when movement is impaired through accident or disease, we get a unique window into the complexity of motor control. Each type of movement disorder highlights different aspects of the motor system, helping us understand how various components contribute to normal function.\nThis knowledge isn’t just academic - it has real-world impact. By understanding the mechanisms behind movement disorders, scientists can develop more effective treatments and rehabilitation strategies. For example, insights from studying balance disorders have led to better treatments for vertigo, while understanding coordination problems has improved therapy for stroke patients.\nWhat’s particularly interesting is how studying movement disorders has revealed the remarkable adaptability of our motor system. Even when parts of the system are damaged, the brain often finds alternative ways to accomplish tasks. This adaptability is both a testament to our motor system’s sophistication and a source of hope for developing new therapeutic approaches."

This practical aspect of motor control knowledge is crucial because movement is inherently about doing rather than just knowing.\nThink about it this way: you can read about how to ride a bicycle all day long, but until you actually get on a bike and try it, you won’t really understand the complex interplay of balance, coordination, and control involved. This is because motor skills involve what we call “tacit knowledge” - knowledge that’s difficult to verbalize but essential for actual performance.\nWhat’s fascinating is how theoretical understanding and practical demonstration work together. When you can connect the scientific principles you’ve learned with actual movement experiences, you develop a deeper understanding of both. For instance, understanding the physics of balance helps you analyze and improve your performance in sports or daily activities.\nThis combination of theory and practice is especially important in fields like physical therapy, sports coaching, and movement education. Being able to demonstrate and explain movements helps others learn more effectively. It’s not enough to know what should happen - you need to be able to show how it happens and guide others in experiencing it themselves."

The field of human motor control tackles fascinating questions like: How do we walk, talk, sing, and smile? How do we manage to perform on the athletic field, play musical instruments, craft tools, and produce works of art?\nUnderstanding how we control our body movements has significant implications across many areas. In sports, where skillful movement is essential, this knowledge can enhance competitive performance. In the fine arts, it can improve self-expression and training methods. In medicine, it helps develop better rehabilitation strategies for those with movement disabilities.\nThe motor system isn’t just about movement - it’s also about stability. Think about holding an object steady while standing in a moving train. Without proper muscular control, such tasks would be impossible. This is why we study both movement and stabilization as part of motor control."

This is where computational analysis comes in, using mathematical models to understand the intricate processes of motor control.\nOne fascinating aspect of motor control is that while most of us can perform complex movements easily, we can’t explicitly explain how we do it. Take riding a bicycle, for example. Even brilliant minds like Albert Einstein would have needed time to explain the physics behind cycling! This is because much of our motor knowledge is tacit or implicit - we know how to do it, but we can’t easily put it into words.\nHowever, through computational analysis, researchers have been able to break down these complex movements into understandable components. For instance, the mathematics of bicycle riding involves maintaining balance by making continuous adjustments: when falling to one side, you turn the handlebars in that direction, creating a centrifugal force that helps maintain balance."

It’s fascinating how understanding what goes wrong can teach us so much about what usually goes right.\nWhen we study normal movement, it’s easy to take for granted how smoothly everything works together. However, when movement is impaired through accident or disease, we get a unique window into the complexity of motor control. Each type of movement disorder highlights different aspects of the motor system, helping us understand how various components contribute to normal function.\nThis knowledge isn’t just academic - it has real-world impact. By understanding the mechanisms behind movement disorders, scientists can develop more effective treatments and rehabilitation strategies. For example, insights from studying balance disorders have led to better treatments for vertigo, while understanding coordination problems has improved therapy for stroke patients."

It’s true! Every movement we make is governed by physical laws and constraints that determine what’s possible and what isn’t.\nThink about it - there are clear physical limits to what our bodies can do. We can only jump so high, run so fast, or push so hard. These limitations aren’t just about our muscles or training; they’re about the basic physics of force, motion, and energy. Understanding these physical principles helps us grasp why certain movements are possible while others aren’t.\nThe physics of movement becomes particularly interesting when we look at complex activities. For instance, when you’re maintaining balance while standing in a moving train, you’re dealing with multiple physical forces: gravity pulling you down, inertia trying to keep you in place, and the train’s acceleration pushing you in different directions. Your motor system has to constantly calculate and adjust to these forces."

This practical aspect of motor control knowledge is crucial because movement is inherently about doing rather than just knowing.\nThink about it this way: you can read about how to ride a bicycle all day long, but until you actually get on a bike and try it, you won’t really understand the complex interplay of balance, coordination, and control involved. This is because motor skills involve what we call “tacit knowledge” - knowledge that’s difficult to verbalize but essential for actual performance.\nWhat’s fascinating is how theoretical understanding and practical demonstration work together. When you can connect the scientific principles you’ve learned with actual movement experiences, you develop a deeper understanding of both. For instance, understanding the physics of balance helps you analyze and improve your performance in sports or daily activities.\nThis combination of theory and practice is especially important in fields like physical therapy, sports coaching, and movement education. Being able to demonstrate and explain movements helps others learn more effectively. It’s not enough to know what should happen - you need to be able to show how it happens and guide others in experiencing it themselves."

Statistics is their secret weapon! This powerful tool helps scientists understand patterns in movement that might not be visible to the naked eye.\nStatistics plays a crucial role in motor control research because human movement naturally varies from one attempt to the next. Even skilled performers never make exactly the same movement twice. By using statistical methods, researchers can distinguish between normal variability and significant changes in performance. This helps us understand what aspects of movement are most important for successful performance.\nThe applications of statistics in motor control research are incredibly diverse. From analyzing the development of fine motor skills in children to studying the effects of aging on movement, statistical tools help reveal patterns and relationships that would otherwise remain hidden."

The cognitive science perspective on motor control reveals the remarkable complexity of the decision-making and problem-solving processes involved in even seemingly simple movements.\nWhat makes this particularly interesting is that most of our movement control happens without conscious thought. Think about it - when you’re walking while having a conversation, you’re not actively thinking about lifting your feet or maintaining balance. Your cognitive system is handling these complex motor tasks automatically, leaving your conscious mind free to focus on the conversation.\nThis automatic processing is a result of sophisticated cognitive mechanisms that have evolved to handle movement efficiently. Your brain is constantly processing sensory information, making split-second decisions, and adjusting your movements in real-time."

Whether you’re threading a needle or catching a ball, your nervous system is processing information and sending signals at lightning speed. This intricate brain-muscle interaction involves multiple areas of the brain, the spinal cord, and a vast network of nerves throughout your body.\nWhat’s particularly fascinating is how the nervous system handles both planned and reactive movements. When you decide to reach for a cup, your brain plans the movement in advance. But if the cup suddenly starts to tip, your nervous system can trigger corrective movements faster than you can consciously think about them."

It’s called the Turing test for motor intelligence, and it’s based on a simple but powerful idea: if a robot can move so naturally that you can’t tell it apart from a human, we’ve achieved a deep understanding of human motor control.\nThis concept comes from Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician who helped crack Nazi codes during World War II. While the original Turing test was about verbal intelligence, the motor version focuses on movement. Imagine watching a robot perform a task - if you can’t tell whether it’s a robot or a human moving, that robot has passed the motor Turing test.\nCurrent robotics gives us a humbling perspective on human motor control. Take the example of humanoid robots playing air hockey - while they can match human performance in this specific task, they’re still far from matching our general movement capabilities."

This fascinating field focuses on how humans interact with their environment and uses that knowledge to create better, more user-friendly designs.\nHuman factors research is all about understanding how people move and interact with objects in their environment. This knowledge is crucial for designing everything from workplace tools to sports equipment. When something is well-designed from a human factors perspective, it works with our natural movement patterns rather than against them, making tasks easier and reducing the risk of errors or injuries.\nWhat’s particularly interesting is how this field combines insights from motor control research with practical design principles. For example, understanding how people naturally reach and grasp objects helps in designing better handles and controls. Knowledge about human attention and motor coordination influences the layout of control panels and interfaces.\nThe impact of human factors research extends far beyond just making things more comfortable. In medical settings, it helps create safer equipment and procedures. In workplaces, it leads to more efficient and ergonomic designs that reduce fatigue and prevent injuries. And in everyday products, it results in designs that are more intuitive and enjoyable to use. It’s amazing how understanding human movement can make such a difference in our daily lives!"

Animal research provides fascinating insights into the fundamental mechanisms of motor control that we share with our fellow creatures on Earth.\nWhat makes animal research so valuable is that many basic movement mechanisms are preserved across species. By studying how animals move, learn new movements, and adapt to different situations, we can better understand the core principles of motor control. This is particularly useful because animals often allow us to study movement in ways that wouldn’t be possible or ethical with human subjects.\nThe applications of this research are quite remarkable. For instance, studying how birds maintain balance during flight has helped us understand human balance control. Research on how animals recover from injuries has led to better rehabilitation strategies for humans."

From sophisticated motion capture systems to detailed analysis of muscle activity, these techniques help us understand the complexities of human movement. It’s amazing how technology has advanced to help us study something as natural as movement in such detail!\nOne of our most powerful tools is motion capture technology - similar to what’s used in making movies and video games. But instead of creating entertainment, we use it to track movement with millimeter precision. Imagine being able to see exactly how a professional athlete’s body moves during a perfect serve in tennis, or how a pianist’s fingers dance across the keys. This technology lets us break down these complex movements into their smallest components.\nWe also use sophisticated equipment like EMG sensors that detect the electrical signals in your muscles, showing us exactly when and how strongly each muscle activates. Combined with force plates that measure the pressures and forces during movement, and eye-tracking devices that show where people look while performing tasks, we get a complete picture of how the body coordinates movement.\nBut perhaps most fascinating is how we study the brain during movement. Using techniques like fMRI and EEG, we can actually see which parts of the brain are active when planning and executing movements. This helps us understand the incredible neural choreography behind even the simplest actions, like reaching for a cup or maintaining balance while walking."

How do we walk, talk, sing, and smile? How do we manage to perform on the athletic field, play musical instruments, craft tools, and produce works of art? How do we learn to carry out these activities, and why are some of us better at them than others? What goes wrong when, through accident or disease, our ability to move is impaired? How can movement disabilities be restored or, better yet, prevented? And how can machines be made to carry out tasks that most people and animals perform effortlessly? As this list of questions suggests, understanding the control of body movements can have significant effects in a wide range of endeavors. This is hardly surprising given that move- ments occur in all walks of life. In sports, where moving skillfully is the very essence of the activity, an understanding of motor control can permit heightened levels of competition. In the fine arts, where performance on stage or in the studio permit self-expression, under- standing how movements are controlled can enhance the quality of that expression and can improve the training that leads to it. In medicine, where paralysis or lack of coordination can sabotage the quality of life, rehabilitation can be refined through deeper appreciation of the means by which the motor system functions. Finally, at home and in the workplace, where machines and other appliances are used, such devices can be made safer and more efficient through the application of principles gained through research on human motor control. Human lvfotor ContTol, Second Edit.ion 1 © 2010, Ehcticr Inc.  2 I. INTRODUCTION The question of how movements are controlled is just one of the questions in this field. The other major one is how we maintain stability. Holding an object steady in the face of changing wind conditions or while standing in a moving train are tasks that demand sta- bilization. Without muscular control, such tasks would be impossible. Because stabilization as well as movement are the jobs of the system covered here, we refer to that system as the motor system, not just the movement system or the stabilization system. The word “motor” has a connotation that is worth dismissing immediately. That conno- tation is machinelike rigidity. Conventional motors churn away monotonously, performing the same motions over and over again. By contrast, behavior is endlessly novel, reflecting millions of years of evolution in which effective strategies developed for adaptation to ever- changing conditions. If you doubt the sophistication of the motor system, consider the state of robots today. These devices embody much of what we know about motor control, but two-legged robots can barely walk across uneven surfaces without toppling over. Getting a robot to make a bed or fold laundry is out of the question. The inability of robots to plan and control physical actions as flexibly as people and ani- mals do means that people rather than robots are often called upon to perform in dangerous situations. Astronauts rather than robots typically carry out repairs in outer space. Beneath the earth, miners place themselves at risk as they pick away at unwieldy surfaces to extract coal or other minerals. On earth’s surface, people defuse mines and sift through rubble after earthquakes, floods, or bomb blasts. If we knew how people control their bodies, we could endow robots with programs that enable the robots to move as people do and carry out dan- gerous and boring tasks that people currently do. UNDERSTANDING HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL What does it mean to understand human motor control? What is to be understood and what form should the understanding take? The answers to these questions are not as obvi- ous as they might seem, for under normal circumstances, movement and stability just seem to happen. When things work well, it is easy to take them for granted. Indeed, a hallmark of skilled performance is that it occurs without the need for attention. When one thinks about performance, one’s performance often suffers (Wulf, 2007). By contrast, in abnormal circumstances, skills may be disrupted. Due to an accident or disease, the ability to move or stabilize the body may be impaired. A wide range of move- ment disorders afflict people, many of which will be discussed in this book. Considering these disorders and the factors that cause them can illuminate the factors that allow for nor- mal performance. That knowledge can in turn contribute to our understanding of motor control in general. What does it mean to understand motor control? One understands a system if one can predict and control it. We do not fully understand the weather, for example, because we cannot predict it, except at a gross level, and we cannot control the weather in any practical sense. On the other hand, we understand aeronautics well enough that we entrust our lives to airplanes traveling at breakneck speeds and at dizzying heights. HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED UNDERSTANDING HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL 3 Virtually all neurologically normal individuals can control their movements reasonably well, but none of these individuals can say in detail how they achieve that control. Most adults can ride a bicycle, for example, but none can say how they do so. Even Albert Einstein would have had to think for a while before saying how he managed to cycle. The fact that the principles of motor control cannot be easily articulated does not mean they can never be verbally expressed. The method for riding a bicycle has been written down: The rule observed by the cyclist is this. When he starts falling to the right he turns the handlebars to the right so that the course of the bicycle is deflected along a curve toward the right. This results in a centrifugal force pushing the cyclist to the left and offsets the gravitational force dragging him down to the right. This maneuver presently throws the cyclist out of balance to the left, which he counteracts by turning the han- dlebars to the left; and so he continues to keep himself in balance by winding along a series of appropriate curvatures. A simple analysis shows that for a given angle of unbalance the curvature of each winding is inversely proportional to the square of the speed at which the cyclist is proceeding [Polanyi, 1964, 49-50]. It is unlikely that Einstein drew on a verbal proposition like this one. The form of knowl- edge he probably relied on, and the form of knowledge that the rest of us use, is tacit or implicit knowledge (Polanyi, 1964). By seeing that the knowledge underlying bike riding and other motor activities can be verbalized, we see that understanding motor control involves being able to state the prin- ciples of motor control. Ultimately, a theory of motor control will have to be expressed in a form that lets the theory be communicated in books such as this one and in scientific articles. In other words, it will have to verbalized. What form should that verbalized theory take? It is possible to demonstrate one’s understanding of a system by simulating it. In the case of motor control, such a demonstration can take the form of a robot that moves in a way that is indistinguishable from the way neurologically normal people do. Such a robot would pass the Turing test of motor intelligence. The term Turing test re.fers to a method of judg- ing intelligence. The test was developed by Alan Turing, a mathematician and philosopher who helped crack the secret code used by the Nazis in World War II. Turing proposed a test for understanding verbally expressed intelligence. In the test, a human participant-call her Elana-interacts with a computer or with another person via a keyboard and display. The critical feature of the setup is that Elana does not know “vith whom she is dealing, a person or a computer. Based on the interactions, she tries to determine whether the individual is a computer or a person. If Elana cannot tell that she is interacting with a computer though her correspondent is in fact a machine, one can say that the designer of the computer succeeded in designing a machine that is as intelligent as a person. A Turing test of motor intelligence would work in similar ways. If Elana watched a robot dancing and thought it was a human being, she could say the designer of the dancing robot had captured, and truly understood, the control of dance. Are we near such a demonstration? Humanoid robots developed by Mitsuo Kawato and his colleagues at the ATR Laboratories in Japan come close to passing the Turing test. One of those robots is shown in Figure 1.1. The robot shown in this figure can play air hockey as well as most people can. Even more interestingly, it does so in a way that is amazingly lifelike. If you find and watch a video of this robot on the world-wide web, be mindful that the person playing against the robot can do something the robot can’t. The person can walk away, stroll down the hall, and, if he hears a child crying out for help in a room he passes, he HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED 4 I. INTRODUCTION FIGURE 1.1 A humanoid robot playing air hockey with a person. From http://lasa.epfl.ch/events/events/ iros03workshop/ AirHockey.jpg. can enter the room and pull the child out from the shelf and pile of books that have landed on him when he decided to climb up on his mother’s bookcase. The robot, by contrast, can do just what it was programmed to do and no more. LEVELS OF ANALYSIS Reflecting on the air-hockey-playing robot, you might say that the lifelike performance of this robot is of only moderate interest, for human beings are made of flesh and blood, whereas robots, or at least robots like the air-hockey-playing robot shown in Figure 1.1, are made of synthetic materials. Doesn’t that difference make the comparison between people and robots irrelevant to the understanding of human motor control? The fact that one actor is real and the other is not does not mean that similarities between them are irrelevant. Apart from the fact that it is fun to watch a machine behave as people do, the deeper reason why robots and people are worth comparing is that different levels of analysis characterize the study of human motor control. Understanding these levels of analysis helps us appreciate why it useful to compare robots to people and animals. David Marr (1982) proposed three levels of understanding for the study of such systems. One level of analysis that Marr identified was the computational level. This level, according to Marr, consists of a description, often expressed mathematically, of one or more functions that a system is supposed to achieve. The cartoon in Figure 1.2 illustrates the computational level. Here a cat prepares to jump onto a table. At some level, the cat’s planning can be rep- resented in equations and diagrams of the sorts that physicists write, although of course the cat does not explicitly use such equations anymore than people do, or, presumably, any HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED LEVELS OF ANALYSIS 5 ’ FIGURE 1.2 The computational level of analysis in motor control. From http://www.thenewyorkerstore.com/ assets/I/ 46752_t.gif. more than Einstein did when he rode his bicycle or carried out other physical activities. Even if equations are not used explicitly, they are used implicitly in performance. The compu- tational level of analysis is concerned with those implicit equations. How the cat actually jumps onto the table is left out of the computational description. The cat might crouch, leap up, prepare to land, and then use its sense of touch to check that it has landed. These behavioral and cognitive states constitute the second of Marr’s levels, what can be called the procedural level. This term is used because it concerns events that occur in real time. (Marr actually used the term algorithmic level, but algorithms are guar- anteed to work. Not all procedures do; getting a basketball to go through a net is not a sure thing, though it relies on a procedure.) The third of Marr’s levels is the implementation level. Here what counts is the physical stuff that permits procedures to be physically achieved. In the case of the jumping cat, the questions relevant to the implementation level are how muscles contract and relax, which brain regions become active or inactive, and so on. If the cat were robotic rather than mam- malian, the relevant issues would be how the hydraulics of the actuators should be used, how the robot’s battery power should be drawn on, and so on. Having identified the three levels in Marr’s triptych-the computational level, the pro- cedural level, and the implementation level-we can now ask”vhich of those three levels is most important in the study of human motor control. One way to address this question is to ask what would happen if any of the levels were excluded. If the implementation level were excluded, most medical conditions involving motor con- trol would be forgotten. No one would want that to happen, of course. We want advances in motor control to help people overcome motor-control difficulties. HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED 6 I. INTRODUCTION If the algorithmic level were excluded, most studies of effective training procedures would be left by the wayside, as would research in the field of human factors-designing safer roads, smarter computer interfaces, and so on. Again, this is not what one would want. Finally, if the computational level were excluded, most efforts to advance robotics would be abandoned. This, too, would be undesirable, for even if you have qualms about robots- perhaps you feel they will take over the jobs of too many people-computational work is of great importance. Thus, the understanding of human motor control requires work at all three levels. No level is more important than any other. All of the levels should be pursued and respected. FIELDS CONTRIBUTING TO RESEARCH ON HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL If all three levels of analysis contribute to the understanding of human motor control, one would expect fields that pursue any of the levels to contribute to this field of study. This is indeed the case, making human motor control a truly interdisciplinary area. Physics As mentioned earlier, physics plays a key role in the study of human motor control. This makes sense, considering that there are physical constraints on what we can do. We can only jump so high, run so fast, push so hard, and so on. Physics helps determine the factors that limit performance. Physics can also indicate the factors that enable performance. A skillful baseball batter can learn how to use the momentum of her bat to maximize the force she exerts on the oncom- ing ball, and she can learn to hit the ball on the bat’s “sweet spot,” where bounce-back is maximized. Similarly, a cat preparing to jump onto a table can learn how to drop on its haunches before leaping up, exploiting elastic energy (Alexander, 1992). Engineering The computational style of analysis used by physicists in their theoretical work has also been used by engineers in their applied work. Men and women in engineering use physical principles to solve practical problems such as designing bridges that don’t fall or designing computers that don’t forget. Engineers also work on issues related to motor control such as robotics and prostheses (artificial appendages used by amputees). One issue that engineers have worked on a great deal is how to use feedback effectively. Feedback is crucial for effective motor control, whether the performance entails standing on a moving train, chasing a fly ball, or driving an automobile. The approach to the analysis of feedback that engineers have developed is called control theory. HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED ORGANIZATJO,’I OF THE BOOK 7 Statistics If you take a pencil and move the tip back and forth as quickly as possible between two target points, always lifting the pencil between the hits, you will end up with a cloud of points near each target. These clouds show that, despite your best intentions, your perform- ance is not perfect. No one’s is. Everyone’s performance is variable to some degree. The study of variability as well as other features of data is the focus of statistics. Some important recent advances in the understanding of human motor control have been made possible through the application of statistics to motor control research. Behavioral Science, Cognitive Science, and Human Factors Researchers who study the procedural level of human motor control work in the fields of behavioral science, cognitive science, and human factors. Behavioral scientists study overt physical activity to predict and, on occasion, control behavior. Cognitive scientists are also interested in the procedural level, but are especially interested in the internal processes that allow behavior to unfold. Cognitive scientists often say they are interested in the software that makes behavior possible. Human factors specialists are interested in the applications of behavioral and cognitive science to practical problems such as desi.gning easy-to-understand road signs, easy-to-use computer interfaces, and easy-to-manipulate hand tools. Scientists in these fields work in academic departments, such as departments of psychology, industrial engineering, physical education, or kinesiology, or in companies or governmental agencies. Chapter 4 provides an overview of behavioral science, cognitive science, and human factors approaches to human motor control. Physiology, Neuroscience, Medicine, and Allied Fields People who study the implementation level of motor control in biological systems are most often associated with physiology. Physiologists interested in motor control focus on mus- cle, bones, and joints, as well as the main regulator of muscle activity, the nervous system, which is the province of neuroscience. The practitioners who apply this information in the clinic are neurologists (who diagnose and treat ailments of the nervous system), orthopedists (who diagnose and treat disorders of bones and joints), physical therapists (who help restore motion and stability through behavioral rehabilitation), and prostheticians (who craft and fit artificial limbs for people with amputations). Rudiments of physiology, neuroscience, medi- cine, and allied fields that pertain to human motor control will be presented in Chapter 3. ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK This book has three main parts. The first is introductory. It contains, besides this chap- ter, Chapter 2 (Core Problems), Chapter 3 (Physiological Foundations), and Chapter 4 (Psychological Foundations). HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED 8 I. INTRODUCTION The second part is organized by activity. Within it, Chapter 5 is concerned with walk- ing and related forms of locomotion. Chapter 6 is concerned with looking, or more specifi- cally, the control of eye and head movements. Chapter 7 focuses on reaching and grasping. Chapter 8 treats the control of drawing and writing. Chapter 9 covers keyboarding (i.e., the control of typewriting, text-messaging, piano playing, and other finger-movement tasks). Chapter 10 covers the control of speaking and singing. Chapter 11, the last chapter in Part II, is concerned with smiling and other forms of facial expression. The third part of the book has a single chapter, Moving On. This chapter presents new advances and new challenges that newcomers to the field may wisih to take up. You should know why the book is organized as it is and why the book has the title it has. Regarding organization, and in particular the devotion of much of the book to distinct activ- ities (Chapters 5-11), this approach has several advantages. One is that research in motor control, like research in most fields today, has become specialized. It is not really a carica- ture of the field to say that there are people who work entirely on eye movements, others who work entirely on reaching and grasping, others who work entirely on speech, and so forth. The proliferation of subspecialties within motor-control research derives partly from the practical and theoretical interests of workers in the field. Practical concerns with particu- lar tasks sometimes compel investigators to pursue particular task domains at the expense of others. A researcher working for a computer company, for example, is likely to be more interested in keyboarding than in singing. Theoretical interests also place some investigators on circumscribed research paths. Students of vision, for example, are naturally more inter- ested in oculomotor (eye movement) control than in speech. The second reason for devoting separate chapters to separate activities is that many of the specialty areas have developed their own problems and methodologies. The twists and turns in one area do not always map easily onto the lines of study in another area, so rather than risk losing the richness of particular areas of study, each area is paid its due by being considered on its own. In treating the subsystems separately, it is critical that the treatment not become too parochial. Areas of common concern need to be highlighted, as does work on the coor- dination of different motor tasks. Being on the lookout for similarities between the motor subsystems puts one in an advantageous position for detecting differences between them. That there might be differences is a real and intriguing possibility, given that some proc- esses may be controlled by independent modules with their own rules of operation (Fodor, 1983). If modularity applies to the motor system, different motor activities might be con- trolled in wholly different ways. Treating the motor activities separately makes it possible to identify those differences if they exist or note their absence if they might otherwise be expected. Regarding the title of the book, Human Motor Control, many but not all of the activities that are discussed here can be carried out only by people, but many of the activities can also be carried out by non-human animals. The word “human” is included in the title even though animal research is discussed throughout the volume. Animal work is important to the understanding of human motor control (and vice versa). The use of the term “motor control” also requires justification, for one might wonder whether there really is a system responsible for motor activity, separate from other systems HUMAN MOTOR CONTROL, 2 ED"
